ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.
