PR: Positive Allred Score: 6 = Proportion Score 4 + Intensity Score 2. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. Microscopic/Diagnostic Dictation: Pathologist, (.

In this case, the largest tumor size is less than or equal to 5.0 cm, but greater than 2.0 cm, which falls in the T2 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), vascular invasion, and the in situ lesion of the type cancerisatio lobulorum do not impact the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2.",T2,True,"The report mentions 'carcinoma ductale bifocale invasivum' which indicates the presence of invasive cancer. However, it does not provide information on the size of the tumor. The report does mention that the tumor is bifocal, but this term refers to the presence of two separate tumors in the same breast, not the size of the tumors. Therefore, we must rely on the information provided in the macroscopic description. The macroscopic description mentions 'carcinoma ductale bifocale' with a 'visual area diameter: 0,55 mm'. However, this measurement likely refers to the size of the biopsy, not the size of the tumor itself. Therefore, we cannot use this information to determine the T stage. However, the report also mentions 'carcinoma ductale in situ (DCIS) within the tumours (solid and cribrate type with high nuclear atypia, and point and comedo. necrosis, 10% of the tumour areas)'. The presence of DCIS does not impact the T stage. Based on the information provided, the tumor size cannot be accurately determined due to its diffuse nature. However, we can use the best estimate based on gross examination. Since the report mentions 'pTic' which indicates that the tumor size is less than or equal to 2.0 cm, we can classify the tumor as T1 stage. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T1.",T2

INTERPRETATION. nuc ish(D17Z1,ERBB2)x2-6[80]. No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu. / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer).
