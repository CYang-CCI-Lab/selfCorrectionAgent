COMMENT: This report was amended to correct the number of positive nodes in the. microscopic section, in the ""Breast Carcinoma Checklist."" The Diagnosis. above is unchanged, and is correct, with a total of 2 positive nodes;. that count has been re-verified by review of the microscopic slides. The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate. that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The ""N"" stage has thus been. corrected to pN1, as well. This case was discussed with. it a recent. conference, and he in fact pointed out this discrepancy. I informed him. at that time that I would make these corrections to the report. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a. year-old woman with biopsy proven infiltrating. lobular cancer of the left breast (ER+ PR+ Her2/neu-). Operative. procedure: Sentinel lymph node biopsies, left modified radical. mastectomy and right simple mastectomy. GROSS: Received are four fresh containers each labeled with the patient's name. A. The first container is additionally labeled ""A - left. sentinel lymph node #1."" The specimen consists of a 2.1 X 2.06 cm. fragment of pale, yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. A single potential. lymph node is identified measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The. node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section. analysis as AFS1. B. The next container is labeled ""B - left sentinel lymph node. #2."" The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm fragment of. yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. Two potential lymph nodes are identified. measuring 0.8 X 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The smaller node is inked. black. The nodes are serially sectioned and entirely submitted for. frozen section analysis as BFS1. The remaining adipose tissue is. submitted for permanent sections in cassette B2. Summary of Sections: BFS1 - two potential sentinel lymph nodes, entirely submitted. B2 - remaining soft tissue. C. The next container is labeled ""C - left breast at 12 o'clock. with left axillary node dissection."" The specimen consists of a 613 gm. modified radical mastectomy with axillary tail. The breast measures 17. cm medial to lateral, 15.5 cm superior to inferior and 3.9 cm. superficial to deep. The attached axillary tail measures 8 X 7.5 x 2. cm. There is an attached ovoid portion of skin measuring 4 X 3.5 cm. with an everted, freely mobile nipple which measures 2.5 X 2.5 cm with. the areolar complex. The deep fascial plane is inked black, the. remaining superior half is inked blue with the remaining inferior half. inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. A gray-white, firm, irregularly-bordered mass is identified in the. upper outer quadrant measuring 3.2 X 2.2 X 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. This mass is consistent with a bilobed single mass. However, it could. represent two separate masses. The central area of the mass is. submitted which could represent normal parenchyma in between the two. masses. The mass is 1.8 cm to the deep margin and 2.5 cm to the nipple. A dumbbell-shaped biopsy clip is identified near the medial portion of. the mass. There are firm, indurated possibly calcified areas located. posteriorly to the nipple. The axillary tail is dissected to reveal 19. potential lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.6 cm in greatest. dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted. The specimen is sectioned. and laced in formalin. Summary of Sections: C1 - middle portion of mass. C2-C3 - medical portion of tumor. C4 - lateral portion of tumor with deep margin.

GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.). A9- tumor #1 approaching superior margin, and tangential sections of deep. margin. A10- fibrous parenchyma between tumor number one and two, grossly free of. tumor. A11- random sections, upper inner quadrant. A12- random sections, upper outer quadrant. A13-14- small tumor in lower outer quadrant (lesion #3) . A15- additional sections, lower outer quadrant. ESE. A16- lower inner quadrant. The attached axillary tail measures 12 x 6 x 3 cm. Within this, multiple. lymph nodes are identified; at least two nodes appear grossly involved with. tumor. 1 of 4. A17- single 3 cm lymph node, grossly positive (a portion of this lymph node is. submitted to Tissue Bank) . A18- multiple lower level axillary lymph node candidates. A19- single lower level axillary lymph node, bisected. A20- single large mid axillary lymph node, bisected. A21- multiple mid axillary lymph nodes. A22- distal axillary lymph nodes. Note: A portion of tumor number one, skin, and grossly positive lymph node. tissue have all been submitted to the Tissue Bank. Per the surgeon, ER/PR. analyses have already been performed, and therefore no additional tissue is. banked for receptor analysis. B. ""Right breast and axillary contents"", fresh. Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant. B8- random sections, upper inner quadrant. B9- random sections, lower inner quadrant. B10-random sections, lower outer quadrant. There is no definite axillary tail attached to the specimen. There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen. Papillomas are present in adjacent breast tissue. DIAGNOSIS: A. ""LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA"": LEFT BREAST WITH THREE SEPARATE FOCI OF BREAST CARCINOMA.

It is not known if HER2. duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Arch Path Lab Med 131:18-43, 2007). A HER2D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene amplification. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined. by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, It is intended as. an adjunct to existing prognostic clinical and pathologic information for breast cancer. patients. This test is not intended to diagnose or screen for breast cancer. Per ASCO/. CAP guidelines, HER2FISH test results are valid for non-decalcified paraffin embedded. specimens fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin between 6 and 48 hours.

SPECIMEN TYPE: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. tissue slide from block B7. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe assay. enables the HER2 gene and Chrl7 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy. on the same slide. Specifically for this assay, HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe. visualized utilizing. SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is. targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. Red ISH DIG detection kit. Dual. ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals. (SISH) and Chrl7 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as. well as in carcinoma cells. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and. Chr17 copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within. 1.8-2.2 (EQUIVOCAL) the reader is recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is. calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gene status is reported as non-amplified (HER2/ Chr 17 < 2.0) or. amplified (HER2/Chrl7>2.0). The performance characteristics of this assay were determined by the. This assay has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ""left modified. radical mastectomy"" is a 1758 gram, 28.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a. linear 5. 0 x 0 x 1.0 cm Representative sections are sampled as labeled: 1. nipple trisected. 2. en face section of areola. 3. deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled. 4-7. sections of described solid tumor mass. 8. section of possible tumor extension abutting inked, inferior,. peripheral margin. 9. sections of upper outer quadrant biopsy cavity. 10. sections from upper outer quadrant. 11. lower outer quadrant sampled. 12. upper inner quadrant. 13. lower inner quadrant. 14-15. representative sections of two separate, large axillary lymph nodes. associated with upper outer quadrant. 16. whole lymph nodes. 17. whole lymph nodes.

The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered.

The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions. of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5 X 5 X 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions. B/BPC. The specimen consists of one portion of tan-yellow adipose tissue,. measuring 5 X 4 X 2 cm. The specimen has been bisected in pathology. consultation. The specimen is serially sectioned and four possible lymph. nodes. ranging from 0.5 CID to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, are identifted. The two largest lymph nodes appear to be involved by neoplasm.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A, B/BPC, & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined. Sections from. specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular. carcinoma, focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size is. difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evident. tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by. carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to bé accurate as. a. true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node. sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/BPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma. morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence of. extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph. nodes. T: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A, B/8PC & C. RIGHT BREAST?
