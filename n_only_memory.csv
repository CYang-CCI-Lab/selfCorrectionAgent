Microscopic Description: Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed. Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and. evaluated for all stains on this case as required.

They. have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. Printed from: Default. Page: 3 of 5. F. 1. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not. necessary for the ASR's. These tests are not investigational. and are used in standard clinical care. In cases where. Immunohistochemistry testing is performed, the following. antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine. therapy for the patient: EFGR(31G7), ER(SP1), PR(1E2),. Her2neu(4B5), CD117(Poly), CD20(L26). Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for.

ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative. percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR are. scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak,. incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is. scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any. proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30%. of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in more. that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed. on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in. paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report. Page: 4 of 5.",0,N1,"The report states that the right simple mastectomy revealed an infiltrating lobular carcinoma with a pathologic stage of pT3 psnNo pMX. The synoptic report further specifies that the sentinel lymph node (C) was negative for metastasis (0/1). However, the report also mentions that the specimen received for the right axilla sentinel lymph node (C) was one piece of fatty tissue measuring 3.3 x 2.4 x 1.0 cm, which suggests that additional lymph nodes may have been examined but not included in the final report. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis in the sentinel lymph node examined (0/1), but we cannot rule out the presence of metastases in other regional lymph nodes. According to the rules provided, the N stage for a patient with no regional lymph node metastasis identified histologically is N0. However, since the report mentions that the tumor is a lobular carcinoma and has metastasized to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, the N stage is N1.", N0," The N stage is N0 as there is no metastasis found in the sentinel lymph node.

What is the T stage from this report?
