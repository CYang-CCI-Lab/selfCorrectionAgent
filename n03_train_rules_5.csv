External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HFR-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the F. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17. with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No:NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.1. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered.

Initially. received in the fresh state for possible Oncogenotyping studies, is a 728 gram left modified radical. mastectomy, 31.8 cm medial to lateral (including axillary extension), 19,7 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm. posterior-anterior. The overlying ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin is 16.9 x 10.2 cm with a paracentral,. darkened brow areola, 3.8 cm in diameter and prominent nipple, 1.3 cm in diameter. A double black. suture marks the lateral apex of the skin. Included within the container is an unoriented, crescent-shaped. strip of wrinkled. tan-brown skin, 19.5 x 1.8 X 1.0 cm. The tentative outer edge of this skin - peripheral. margin is marked blue and the remaining surgical margins are marked yellow. The surgical margins of the. mastectomy are differentially inked as follows: Superior superficial: Blue,. Inferior superficial: Orange,. Posterior; Black. The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the medial-lateral long axis (slab 1 assigned at. the base of the axillary extension of fat) to reveal a well-circumscribed, light tan, centrally softened tumor. mass measuring upwards of 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm (slabs 4-6, from lateral). The tumor is grossly placed 1.5 cm. from the superior superficial, 1.3 cm deep to the skin, 2.3 cm from the deep surgical margin, 3.5 cm from. the most lateral extension of breast (not including axillary extension), greater than 6.0 cm from the inferior. superficial surgical margin, and greater than 6.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast.

It. consists of a modified radical mastectomy which weighs 2,220 grams. Overall, the specimen measures 28. x 23 x 6 cm. There is an overlying broad ellipse of brown skin measuring 30 X 19.5 cm. Centrally and. slightly superiorly within the skin, there is a 7.5 cm areola and a protuberant 1.5 cm nipple. The. peripheral skin displays five sharply delineated dark brown, smooth, shiny papules. The anterior-superior. margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists. of smooth facial tissue, is inked black. Axillary tissue is present with at stitch marking the axilla. The. axillary tail measures 10 x 5 X 2 cm. in the lower outer quadrant of the breast, there is palpably firm and. hemorrhagic breast parenchyma which is very poorly delineated. There is some bright yellow. discoloration of the associated fatty tissue. This area of firm fibrous parenchyma involves an area. Printed: This report continues.

Tumor type: invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive fibrosis (see comment). Nottingham combined histologic grade: 2. Tubule formation score: 2. Nuclear Pleomorphism Score: 3. Mitotic count score: 2. Focality of tumor: single focus. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.5 cm (see comment). Lymphovascular invasion: present (A8). In Situ Component: present. In Situ Component type/Architecture pattern: solid and cribriform. In Situ Component nuclear grade: 3. In Situ Component necrosis: none identified. In Situ Component extent/size: DCIS is present with tumor and focally away from tumor. Size is approximately 6 mm. Extensive intraductal component: Absent. The DCIS comprises approximately 2% of total tumor. Nipple involvement: none identified. Skin involvement: none identified. Margin status: nvasive component: >5 mm. in Situ component: >5 mm. Axillary lymph nodes: Total number with metastasis: 7. Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below). Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15). Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue. Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis. Other findings: - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Benign skeletal muscle. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to. change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%. Progesterone receptor (. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 12%. HER2/neu (Ventana, clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Negative (not overexpressed).
