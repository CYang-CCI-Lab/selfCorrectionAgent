Select slides from. part C were shown at the. the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed A2. and concurs with the diagnosis. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C9. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification.

Representative. sections are sequentially submitted, from medial to lateral. in six cassettes. as follows: cassette 1 - medial margin; cassette 2 - nipple with anterior. aspect: cassette 3 - tumor mass with closest posterior margin; cassette 4 -. tumor mass with superior margin; cassette 5 - tumor mass with inferior margin;. cassette 6 - tumor mass with lateral margin. C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-yellow fatty tissue. measuring 5 X 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 X 0.3 x. 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 X 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest. lymph node shows foci of tan-gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely. submitted in four cassettes as follows cassette 1 - one intact and one. bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node: cassette 3 - two bisected. lymph nodes (one inked black): cassette 4 - largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A & APC. One slide is examined for each portion of the case. Both slides. demonstrate extensive lymph node involvement by poorly differentiated. carcinoma. Because of the obvious nature of this finding, it will not be. necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain. B/BPC. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without. evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of. tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy. ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3. shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of. lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-lik areas and numerous foci of. ""Indian file"" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1. mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of. tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli. and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically. active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present. within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this. lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows. no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear. inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site dre. also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6. C.

""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.).

Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant.

There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..

B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the -. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu. /CEP17. Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Malignant neoplasm of breast, left. Gross Description: Single specimen designated as left breast mastectomy, stitch is lateral, with axillary dissection. Initially. received in the fresh state for possible Oncogenotyping studies, is a 728 gram left modified radical. mastectomy, 31.8 cm medial to lateral (including axillary extension), 19,7 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm. posterior-anterior. The overlying ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin is 16.9 x 10.2 cm with a paracentral,. darkened brow areola, 3.8 cm in diameter and prominent nipple, 1.3 cm in diameter. A double black. suture marks the lateral apex of the skin. Included within the container is an unoriented, crescent-shaped. strip of wrinkled. tan-brown skin, 19.5 x 1.8 X 1.0 cm. The tentative outer edge of this skin - peripheral. margin is marked blue and the remaining surgical margins are marked yellow.

The first specimen submitted in the fresh state is labeled ""right breast tissue"" The. specimen is the right breast, total mastectomy specimen Suture marks the axillary tail of. the breast. There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5. cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position The overlying superficial margin. adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked. with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges. are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized In the center. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. À. portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to. within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 O'clock. at its closest point. It is located well above the deep margin which is approximately 7 cm. beneath the mass. Cut sections through the remainder of the breast tissue reveals some. rubbery white parenchymal breast tissue and abundant yellow fat. There. are. other. nodules or mass is identified. Sections are submitted as follows: A1. nipple. A2-5 -. mass in breast. A6. mass in breast with adjacent tissue. A7-9 -. non-neoplastic appearing breast tissue. B. The. second specimen is received in the fresh state in the operating room and represents. two axillary lymph nodes, one measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.7 x. 0.7. cm. The cut sections are hard. A section of each is examined by frozen section. These are submitted in block B1, frozen section control. Additional section of each is. submitted in block B2. C. The. third specimen initially in the fresh state is labeled ""sentinel node #1"" and is a. piece of yellow fat measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm round moderately firm lymph node. which is bisected and submitted in toto in block C1. D. The fourth specimen is labeled ""level 3 axillary nodes"" The specimen is a piece of. yellow fatty tissue measuring 9 x 3 x 1.! cm with a suture marking the highest level 3. lymph node. There are five additional small lymph nodes. The highest node is submitted in. block D1 and the other five lymph nodes are submitted in block D2. E. The fifth container is labeled ""right axillary contents"" The specimen is yellow fatty. tissue measuring 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm. Within the fatty tissue are several nodules consistent. with. lymph nodes.
