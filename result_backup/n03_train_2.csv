INTERPRETATION. nuc ish(D17Z1,ERBB2)x2-6[80]. No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu. / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FISH test was developed and Its performance determined by the. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, this laboratory has established and vermed the test's. accuracy and precision.

The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. It. consists of a mastectomy specimen together with axillary ussue weighing 292 grams. The breast measures. 16 cm from medial to lateral, 9 cm from superior to inferior and up to 4 cm from superficial to deep. There. is an overlying ellipse of dark brown skin which measures 15.5 x 7.6 cm. Slightly medially located within. the skin is a circumscribed 2,5 cm areola and a protuberant 0,6 cm nipple, The skin is unremarkable. Axillary tissue is present and measures 15 x 6.5 X 1.8 cm. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. auterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth facial tissue, is. inked black. in the central lateral portion of the deep margin, there is a 3 x 0,5 cm band of skeletal muscle. which is indicated by the surgeon as pectoralis major behind the tumor. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a relatively well-circumscribed. firm,. tan-white tumor mass beginning directly underneath the nipple and extending laterally within the breast. This tumor mass measures 4,7 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 em from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm from. superticial to deep. This neoplasm is 3.5 cm from the closest medial margin, 5 cm from the axillary tail,. 2.5 cm from the closest superior margin, and 2.2 cm from the closest inferior margin. Centrally, it is grossly. 0.2 cm from the closest deep margin and does not appear to extend into the small strip of pectoralis. muscle. The remainder of the breast is composed of soft fatty tissue without other palpable masses. Representative tumor and adjacent breast parenchyma are obtained for research purposes. In the medial. portion of the axillary tail, there is a prominent firm 1.5 cm lymph node suspicious for metastatic. involvement. Representative tissue from this lymph node is obtained for research purposes also. The. axillary tissue is dissected for nodes. Representaitve sections are submitted.

The specimen consists of an. irregular ovoid fragment of firm pink and yellow-tan tissue measuring 2 x 1.5. x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen has been previously. submitted as frozen section AF1, and portion of tissue has been previously. submitted for ER/PR evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in. Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This is. located more centrally but in the lower outer quadrant. The larger firm mass. surrounding the biopsy cavity to within approximately 0.5 cm of the surgical. margin but the fibroadipose tissue on the deep surface is easily clear over. the lesions. Tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the superior surgical margin. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1-B2- representative sections of mass and adjacent biopsy cavity.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc. bllowing the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number, and additionally identified as, 'right breast'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 653 gm modified radical mastectomy. specimen. The specimen is oriented with a short suture designating the superior. margin and a long suture designating lateral margin. The specimen measures 18.5. cm from superior to inferior, 22.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.9 cm from. anterior to posterior. There is an attached 9.6 X 7.9 X 1.5 cm axillary tail. On the anterior surface is a 18.0 X 8.0 cm tannish brown ellipse of skin with a. 4.0 X 4.5 cm areola and a 1.5 X 1.4 X 0.5 cm raised nipple. The nipple-areolar. complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or retraction. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue;. inferior edge - green;. posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to. reveal a rubbery, irregularly shaped, white-tan, 4.5 X 3.5 x 2.5 cm mass with. a. granular cut surface in slices 3 through 5. A clip is identified in slice 3. The. mass is 0.5 cm from the posterior margin and widely free (>2 cm) from the. anterior superior and anterior inferiormargins. The remainder of the specimen. consists of approximately 30% dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 70%. lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly. identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown,. rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.3-2.5 cm in greatest dimension.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The L. takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer. PRE-OPERTATIVE CONSULTATION: TPA/TPB/TPC: Negative for carcinoma.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: BPC DIAGNOSIS: "" (Smear) Lymph node positive for carcinoma"" by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions. of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5 X 5 X 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions. B/BPC. The specimen consists of one portion of tan-yellow adipose tissue,. measuring 5 X 4 X 2 cm. The specimen has been bisected in pathology. consultation. The specimen is serially sectioned and four possible lymph. nodes. ranging from 0.5 CID to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, are identifted. The two largest lymph nodes appear to be involved by neoplasm. Representative. sections submitted in three cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - two. intact. lymph nodes; cassette 2 - one lymph node; cassette 3 one lymph node. are -. C.

Three lymph nodes are grossly involved by neoplasm. Representative sections. are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - six intact lymph. nodes: cassette 2 - one bisected lymph node; cassette 3 - .three lymph nodes: cascatts 4 - five intact lymph nodes. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A, B/BPC, & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined. Sections from. specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular. carcinoma, focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size is. difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evident. tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by. carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to bé accurate as. a. true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node. sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/BPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma. morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence of. extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph. nodes. T: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A, B/8PC & C. RIGHT BREAST?
