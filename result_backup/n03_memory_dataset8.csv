Sentinel lymph node;Right Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right axillary sentinel lymph node #960 and is received in formalin. It consists. of a 2.9 X 2.2 X 0.7 cm discoid lobulated portion of fatty tissue. On dissection a single 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. lymph node is recovered. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the. specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Medially and. inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The. breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area. of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral,. 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep. The fibrous tissue is separated from. the deep margin by a thin layer of movable fascial tissue. The fibrous breast parenchyma is 3 cm from the. Pathology Consultation Report.

It is 1 cm from the closest skin and abuts the fascial margin of the posterior breast centrally. Representative samples of this tissue are obtained for research purposes. Sections of this fibrous breast. tissue reveal a central and inferiorly located area of hemorrhage with a twisted biopsy site clip. The. remainder of the breast is composed predominantly of fatty tissue but rubbery fibrous parenchyma extends. to the lower-outer quadrant. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the tail of the breast. Representative. sections are submitted. Section summary: B1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple,. B2) central deep margin (fascial tissue),. B3) medial edge of central fibrous tissue,.

Tumor type: invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive fibrosis (see comment). Nottingham combined histologic grade: 2. Tubule formation score: 2. Nuclear Pleomorphism Score: 3. Mitotic count score: 2. Focality of tumor: single focus. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.5 cm (see comment). Lymphovascular invasion: present (A8). In Situ Component: present. In Situ Component type/Architecture pattern: solid and cribriform. In Situ Component nuclear grade: 3. In Situ Component necrosis: none identified. In Situ Component extent/size: DCIS is present with tumor and focally away from tumor. Size is approximately 6 mm. Extensive intraductal component: Absent. The DCIS comprises approximately 2% of total tumor. Nipple involvement: none identified. Skin involvement: none identified. Margin status: nvasive component: >5 mm. in Situ component: >5 mm. Axillary lymph nodes: Total number with metastasis: 7. Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below). Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15). Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue. Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis. Other findings: - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Benign skeletal muscle. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to. change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%. Progesterone receptor (. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 12%. HER2/neu (Ventana, clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Negative (not overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 1+. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A7. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show appropriate staining. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR) or. research use only (RUO) reagents.

The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. immunohistochemical studies. Estrogen receptor (1. 1, clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 94%. Progesterone receptor t. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Negative. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 0%. HER2/neu (. clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Positive (overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 3+ (see note). NOTE: This block (A5) includes areas that show morphologies similar to both the superficial and deep cores. ER and PR are. relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor, regardless of morphology. Immunostain for HER2 is heterogeneous, but. staining does not correlate with any particular morphology. There is enough strong complete staining to interpret the. HER2 as 3+ (overexpressed); however, areas in this block range from no staining to strong and complete staining. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A5. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE.

""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mÃ¡stectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.).

Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant.

There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.

Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1. (lymph node). The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Submitted in toto in. A1. B. LEFT BREAST. Received fresh labeled ""left breast"" is a 1,184-gram simple mastectomy specimen (27.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm) with. a. stitch on the axillary tail. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin (15.0 x 10.5 cm) with a 1. cm centrally located, partially flattened nipple and 3.5 cm areola rim. The skin surface is remarkable for a grey-white,. well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1 cm that is 8.0 cm from the nipple. The specimen is inked. and serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 14 being most lateral. The. nipple is located in slice 8. The cut surface reveals a grey-white, firm, stellate mass (6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm) located in. the upper central and upper outer quadrants and present in slices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This mass measures 1.5 cm. from all margins. A second lesion is located in the 7 o'clock position (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in slice 6. Lesion #2 is. located 0.6 cm from lesion #1, and measures 1.5 cm from the closest inferior margin. An ill-defined nodular area. (lesion 3) is located 4.5 cm superior to lesion #2 in slice 6 and more than 2.0 cm from the deep margin. A portion of. the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.

Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None given. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed mild polysomy 17 with 2. to 3 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 5 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. B20. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom HerceptinÂ® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. /, under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

There is a broad overlying semi-circular portion of tan skin measuring 23 x 14.5 cm. In the medial. inferior edge of the skin, there is a 4.5 cm areola with a protuberant 1.4 cm nipple. The skin is otherwise. unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and. the posterior margin, which partially consists of smooth facial appearing tissue, is inked black. The. specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white. fibrous parenchyma. In the central inferior portion of the breast, along the superior medial edge of the. areola, there is an area of fibrous parenchyma which has a slightly stellate appearance but is soft and. rubbery. This stellate area is 2 cm in maximum dimension. It is 4 cm or greater from the deep, inferior,. and superior margin and is 2 cm from the closest skin. The breast parenchyma in the lower outer quadrant. has a rough fine nodular feel but there are no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance.
