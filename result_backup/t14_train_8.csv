External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: year old with left breast ca. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast ca.

There is moderate nuclear staining in 60% of tumor. cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is positive for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block F8 using the CB11. monocional antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

It consists. of a 2.9 X 2.2 X 0.7 cm discoid lobulated portion of fatty tissue. On dissection a single 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. lymph node is recovered. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the. specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Medially and. inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The. breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area. of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral,. 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep. The fibrous tissue is separated from. the deep margin by a thin layer of movable fascial tissue. The fibrous breast parenchyma is 3 cm from the. Pathology Consultation Report.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a. linear 5. 0 x 0 x 1.0 cm Representative sections are sampled as labeled: 1. nipple trisected. 2. en face section of areola. 3. deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled. 4-7. sections of described solid tumor mass. 8. section of possible tumor extension abutting inked, inferior,. peripheral margin. 9. sections of upper outer quadrant biopsy cavity. 10. sections from upper outer quadrant. 11. lower outer quadrant sampled. 12. upper inner quadrant. 13. lower inner quadrant. 14-15. representative sections of two separate, large axillary lymph nodes. associated with upper outer quadrant. 16. whole lymph nodes. 17. whole lymph nodes.
