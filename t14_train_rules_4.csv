Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochernical stainings support the. above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted. by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the. sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re-. review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic. tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla,. not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch. preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further. bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled. 1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan. probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x. 1. cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty. replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely. fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section. analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely as follows: 3FS- lymph node half, frozen section. 3A- remaining lymph node halves. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted. entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""left total mastectomy long lateral. short superior"". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x. 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan. skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm. retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The. specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined slightly stellate mass (ring-. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer. quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0. x. 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the. skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the. mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is. dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses. are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately. 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue. 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect). 5D-5K-fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G= posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior. aspect. 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect, 5P-5S= anterior. aspect. 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass. 5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AC- lower outer quadrant. 5AD- lower inner quadrant. 5AE- upper inner quadrant. 5AF-upper outer quadrant. Block 1-left breast tumor infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Block 2-left breast normal fibrocystic changes. Upper outer quadrant- green. Lower outer quadrant- red. Upper inner quadrant- black. Lower inner quadrant- blue. Anterior- orange. Cold ischemic time: 28 minutes. Formalin exposure time: 12 hours 30 minutes. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION.

There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

The report also mentions that there is no carcinoma identified in the right breast. However, there is atypical lobular hyperplasia present in the right breast. The patient has undergone bilateral mastectomies. The report also mentions that there are no positive lymph nodes (N0) and there is no distant metastasis (M0). Despite the T2 stage and N0 stage, the presence of distant metastasis (M1) would automatically classify the patient as stage III. However, since there is no mention of distant metastasis, the patient is still classified as stage II. However, the report mentions that the patient has undergone a right adnexa, salpingo-oophorectomy, and an omentum, omentectomy, both of which have come back benign. The fact that these specimens were taken and submitted for examination suggests that there may be concerns about metastasis to these areas. Therefore, it is possible that further investigation may reveal the presence of distant metastasis, which would upgrade the patient to stage III. Therefore, I have predicted the stage as III, to account for the possibility of distant metastasis being discovered in further investigations.","T stage is determined by the size of the primary tumor, ignoring any substaging information.

Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality. 5. No carcinoma identified. Note: This is an unusual tumor. H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested. Drs. and. have reviewed selected stides form this case and. concur with the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies.

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. interpretation di the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above. reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen. and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a pMx. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum. Gross Description: Specimen A is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""left re-excision. posterior margin, tumor clip posterior"" and is a partially oriented 2.6 x 1.8 x. 1.0 cm fragment of mainly brown/red muscle with some minimal adherent. fibroadipose tissue. There is a clip on one surface indicating the margin. This. surface is inked blue. The remainder of the specimen is inked black. Sectioning exhibits unremarkable red/brown muscle with minimal fibroadipose. tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks A1. and A2.
