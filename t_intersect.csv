Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2.", T2," The T stage is T2, as the invasive ductal carcinoma measures 1.1 cm in largest dimension.

What is the N stage from this report?
The N stage is N1mi, as there is micrometastatic carcinoma (0.5 mm) in one sentinel lymph node without extracapsular extension.

What is the M stage from this report?
There is no information about distant metastasis in this report, so the M stage cannot be determined.

Therefore, the pathologic stage is T2N1mi."

This cancer shows HER2/neu protein. overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel. lymph node No. 1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible. by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision. below). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;.

TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Right breast mastectomy and Sentinel node biopsy. Gross Description. Print Date/Time: Female. Collected Date/Time: Received Date/Time: Specimen is received in 2 parts: A. The specimen is labeled ""RIGHT SENTINEL NODE"" and is received unfixed for frozen section diagnosis. (The specimen is in the. formalin. more. than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consists of a large lymph node measuring 3.5 x 2 x 2 cm. Sectioned and. entirely submitted in cassettes FSA 1-FSA3. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 27 minutes. B. The specimen is labeled ""RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY NODES I AND II"" and is received in formalin. (The specimen is. in the formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1150. grams and measuring 30 x 22 x 7 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 21 x 10 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 2.0 cm in. diameter nipple. The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating the axilla The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia. which is inked black. The breast is sliced in sagittal planes revealing a 5 x 5 x 4 cm hemorrhagic cavity within the upper inner-central. quadrants which is 0.7 cm away from the closest deep fascial margin of resection. The remaining parenchyma reveals unremarkable. yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 = one lymph node, bisected. B2 = one lymph node, bisected. B3 = one lymph node, bisected. B4 = 5 lymph nodes. B5 = 2 lymph nodes, one bisected. B6 = one lymph node, bisected. B7 = one lymph node, bisected. B8 = one lymph node, bisected. B9-E = upper inner quadrant-central mass. B13 = mass closest to deep fascial margin of resection. B14 = nipple. B15 = upper inner quadrant. B16 = upper outer quadrant. B17 = lower outer quadrant. B18 = lower inner quadrant. B19-28= additional sections from biopsy cavity. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 18 minutes. Intra Operative Consultation. Right sentinel lymph node: one lymph node, positive for carcinoma (1/1). Special Stains/Slides. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Block B2, B5, B6) with adequate positive. and negative control sections. Immunostains for keratins AE1/AE3 are negative for carcinoma. Print Date/Time: Collected Date/Time: Received Date/Time: The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such. clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is. certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical laboratory testing. Tissue Code.",1,T1c,"The report specifies that the 'SIZE OF LARGEST INVASIVE CARCINOMA: Microinvasion only (<=0.1 cm). Greatest dimension of largest focus of invasion over 0.1 cm: 1.1 cm.' This indicates that the largest focus of invasion is 1.1 cm, which falls under T1c (Tumor >10 mm but less than or equal to 20 mm in greatest dimension) according to the rules provided.", T1c," The T stage is pT1c, as the largest invasive carcinoma measures 1.1 cm.

What is the N stage from this report?
The N stage is pN1a, as there is metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, with at least one metastasis greater than 2.0 mm.

What is the overall pathologic stage of the cancer?
The overall pathologic stage is stage IIA (T1c N1a M0)."
