Metastatic carcinoma in three of fifteen lymph nodes (3/15). - Largest metastatic focus: 0.9 cm in diameter. - Extranodal extension present. - Positive lymph nodes are sentinel lymph nodes #2, #3, and #4. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2-3. Type and grade (in situ): DCIS, high-nuclear grade. Primary tumor: pT1c(m). Regional lymph nodes: pN1c. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Stage: IIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Indeterminate. Margin status: Negative. COMMENT: The three foci of invasive carcinoma have similar histologic features,. although the tumor grade is somewhat variable in the largest tumor nodule, where. there is a variable rate of mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism ranging from. intermediate to high-grade. The smaller tumor nodules contain high-grade malignant. Printed: This report continues. Acct No. -. Pathology - Page 1/6. Page 1 Doc# 1.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section. diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. Part C, labeled. consists of a single soft,. irregular piece of red-yellow, fatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm. Fatty tissue is trimmed away,. and a single candidate lymph node is found. The candidate fymph node is entirely submitted for. frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted in cassette C1. The remaining unused fatty. tissue is entirely submitted in cassette C2. Part D, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette D1. Part E, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette E1. Part F is received in formalin and additionally labeled. It consists of a 9-gm. breast lumpectomy specimen, measuring 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 5 cm from superior to. inferior, and 3.5 cm from lateral to medial. There is a short stitch designated as superior and a long. stitch designated as lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior superior blue, anterior inferior. green, and posterior black. Prior to receipt by me (Dr. the posterior portion of the. breast has been incised and tissue removed for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned,. from medial to lateral, into eight slices and reveals a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule (1.5 x 1 x. 0.9 cm) in slices 3 through 6. The tumor nodule is located approximately 1 cm from both the lateral-. and medial-most margins, 0.7 cm from the superior margin, and 1.3 cm from the inferior margin. The. closest approach to a margin is in slice 6, where it appears to abut the anterior-mid portion of the. specimen (<1 mm grossly from the blue/green-inked margin). The specimen is entirely submitted as. follows: Cassette F1: Medial-most margin. Cassette F2: Slice 2, superior. Cassette F3: Slice 2, inferior. Cassette F4: Slice 3, superior (and nodule).

The specimen is. trimmed and extensively searched for lymph nodes. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found and. submitted intact in cassettes G1-G5. Fee Codes: Working Draft. Addenda. Addendum. Date Complete: Addendum Comment. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block F6. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in ~50% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is weak to moderate nuclear staining in ~15%. of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block F6 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: E - right breast wide local excision needle localization: Tumor is 1.7 cm located 1.3 cm from the nearest/lateral. margin called by Dr to Dr. at. ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above. reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen. and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions. of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5 X 5 X 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A, B/BPC, & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined. Sections from. specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular. carcinoma, focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size is. difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evident. tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by. carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to bé accurate as. a. true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node. sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/BPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma. morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence of. extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph. nodes. T: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A, B/8PC & C. RIGHT BREAST?

Initially. received in the fresh state for possible Oncogenotyping studies, is a 728 gram left modified radical. mastectomy, 31.8 cm medial to lateral (including axillary extension), 19,7 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm. posterior-anterior. The overlying ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin is 16.9 x 10.2 cm with a paracentral,. darkened brow areola, 3.8 cm in diameter and prominent nipple, 1.3 cm in diameter. A double black. suture marks the lateral apex of the skin. Included within the container is an unoriented, crescent-shaped. strip of wrinkled. tan-brown skin, 19.5 x 1.8 X 1.0 cm. The tentative outer edge of this skin - peripheral. margin is marked blue and the remaining surgical margins are marked yellow. The surgical margins of the. mastectomy are differentially inked as follows: Superior superficial: Blue,. Inferior superficial: Orange,. Posterior; Black. The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the medial-lateral long axis (slab 1 assigned at. the base of the axillary extension of fat) to reveal a well-circumscribed, light tan, centrally softened tumor. mass measuring upwards of 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm (slabs 4-6, from lateral). The tumor is grossly placed 1.5 cm. from the superior superficial, 1.3 cm deep to the skin, 2.3 cm from the deep surgical margin, 3.5 cm from. the most lateral extension of breast (not including axillary extension), greater than 6.0 cm from the inferior. superficial surgical margin, and greater than 6.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast.

C6 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned. C7,C8 - largest lymph node candidate, sectioned. Procedures/Addenda: Addendum. Addendum. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative. blocks of axillary. lymph nodes (C6 and C7) and the results are as follows: CD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular. distribution. CD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of. the paracortex. Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild. paracortical. expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic. lymphadenopathy.",BRCA
