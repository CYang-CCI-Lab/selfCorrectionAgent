Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako. following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunoristochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. I. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A8. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. 1. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.). A9- tumor #1 approaching superior margin, and tangential sections of deep. margin. A10- fibrous parenchyma between tumor number one and two, grossly free of. tumor. A11- random sections, upper inner quadrant. A12- random sections, upper outer quadrant. A13-14- small tumor in lower outer quadrant (lesion #3) . A15- additional sections, lower outer quadrant. ESE. A16- lower inner quadrant. The attached axillary tail measures 12 x 6 x 3 cm. Within this, multiple. lymph nodes are identified; at least two nodes appear grossly involved with. tumor. 1 of 4. A17- single 3 cm lymph node, grossly positive (a portion of this lymph node is. submitted to Tissue Bank) . A18- multiple lower level axillary lymph node candidates. A19- single lower level axillary lymph node, bisected. A20- single large mid axillary lymph node, bisected. A21- multiple mid axillary lymph nodes. A22- distal axillary lymph nodes. Note: A portion of tumor number one, skin, and grossly positive lymph node. tissue have all been submitted to the Tissue Bank. Per the surgeon, ER/PR. analyses have already been performed, and therefore no additional tissue is. banked for receptor analysis. B. ""Right breast and axillary contents"", fresh. Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant. B8- random sections, upper inner quadrant. B9- random sections, lower inner quadrant. B10-random sections, lower outer quadrant. There is no definite axillary tail attached to the specimen. There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen. Papillomas are present in adjacent breast tissue. DIAGNOSIS: A. ""LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA"": LEFT BREAST WITH THREE SEPARATE FOCI OF BREAST CARCINOMA.

This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTes. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays.

Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,. HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines witn nigh, low and negauve HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this. patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score)/Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.
