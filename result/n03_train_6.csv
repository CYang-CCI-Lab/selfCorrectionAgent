The axillary contents measure 16 x 11 x 4 cm,. palpation of which reveals clinically suspicious lymph nodes. The breast weighs ,457. g. and measures 30 x 18 x 6 cm. Skeletal muscle fibers are present on the deep margin. À large mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant. The deep margin adjacent to this area. is inked blue. The breast is covered by a 30 x 18 cm ellipse of dark brown skin. The. nipple and areolar complex is centrally placed. The nipple measures 2.5 cm in diameter and. is somewhat firm on palpation The breast is serially sectioned revealing a. well-circumscribed grayish-white tumor within the upper outer quadrant measuring 3 x 3.5 x. measures 4 3 cm. The tumor lies 1.5 cm from the skin surface. On further evaluation. there. cm À portion of the tumor is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The deep margin. is an apparent separate tumor in the upper outer quadrant with a core needle biopsy. track. and this tumor measures 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. This tumor is well away from the surgical margins. The remainder of the breast tissue is fatty in nature. No other discrete lesions are. identified. Examination of the axillary contents reveals multiple lymph nodes which range. from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension each. Some of these are grossly involved by. tumor.

Diagnosis called at. by Dr. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Case oAnalytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. natients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. Microscopic/Diagnostic Dictation:,.

The posterior surface of the breast is. inked black and the anterior blue. Part of the posterior surface of the. breast is covered by dark red skeletal muscle, measuring 11 x 4 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular tumor bed (10 x. 8.3 x 5.1 cm) with poorly defined white, firm and tan areas. The tumor bed. occupies almost the entire breast volume, extending throughout all four. quadrants. The tumor bed is located 0.2 cm from the posterior margin, 0.3 cm. from the anterior margin, and 0.5 cm from the skeletal muscle. The remaining. breast tissue shows yellow fatty areas with foci of fibrosis. The axillary. tissue is dissected to reveal 13 possible lymph nodes, ranging in size from. 0.4 cm to 1.2 cm.

Select slides from. part C were shown at the. the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed A2. and concurs with the diagnosis. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C9. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako. a) following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified.

Block Number: D9. Interpretation: NEGATIVE. Intensity: 1+. % Tumor Staining: 8%. Fish Ordered: No. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.
