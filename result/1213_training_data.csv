Skin, newest anterior/superior/medial margin, excision: No significant pathologic. abnormality, no tumor. H. Left breast, new nipple margin, biopsy: Benign lactiferous ducts, no in situ or. invasive tumor. I. Non-sentinel lymph node #1, dissection: No tumor in two (0/2). J. Non-sentinel lymph node #2, biopsy: No tumor in one (0/1). Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1. (lymph node). The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

The T stage is primarily based on the size of the tumor and its extent.",T2,True,"The divergence in reasoning occurred because the initial assessment focused solely on the tumor size (6.5 cm) without fully considering other factors that contribute to the T stage, such as the involvement of the nipple-areolar complex by invasive carcinoma and the presence of extensive vascular invasion. However, according to the AJCC TNM classification system, a tumor is classified as T4 if it involves the chest wall or skin, but involvement of the nipple-areolar complex alone does not automatically classify it as T4. The correct classification of T3 is based on the tumor size being more than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm in its greatest dimension, without evidence of chest wall or skin involvement.","['When determining the T stage, carefully evaluate the tumor size as reported in the pathology findings, considering both gross and microscopic measurements if provided.', 'Apply the AJCC TNM criteria strictly, where T2 is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, and T3 is defined as a tumor more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.', 'Always consider the possibility of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which would classify the tumor as T4, regardless of size.', 'Be aware of amendments or changes in the pathology report that may affect the T stage, such as changes in tumor size or the presence of additional tumor foci.', 'When determining the T stage, ensure that the tumor size is measured accurately and apply the AJCC criteria correctly: T1 corresponds to tumors 2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension.', 'Always verify that the reported tumor size aligns with the AJCC definitions for each T stage, considering the greatest dimension of the tumor.', 'Be aware of the specific AJCC criteria for T staging, including the distinctions between T1 (2.0 cm or less), T2 (more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm), T3 (more than 5.0 cm), and T4 (any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin).', 'When determining the T stage, consider not only the size of the invasive tumor but also its extent and relationship to the chest wall or skin.', 'For T3 tumors, the key criterion is the size of the tumor being more than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm in greatest dimension, or any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin, excluding the pectoralis muscle adherence.', 'Always carefully review the pathology report for descriptions of tumor size, location, and extension to accurately apply AJCC criteria.', 'When determining the T stage, focus on the size of the largest single focus of invasive carcinoma, not the cumulative size of all lesions or the size of in situ components.', 'For multicentric cancers (multiple separate foci of cancer in different quadrants of the breast), the T stage is determined by the largest single invasive carcinoma focus, regardless of the number of foci.', 'When determining the T stage, consider not only the size of the primary tumor but also its extension to adjacent structures such as the skin or chest wall.', 'The presence of skin ulcerations or satellite nodules should be carefully evaluated as these can affect the T stage classification, potentially upgrading it to a higher stage such as T4.', 'Always refer to the latest AJCC TNM staging manual for the most current criteria and guidelines, as updates can impact staging classifications.', 'When determining the T stage, prioritize the tumor size as the primary factor unless specific criteria for T3 (more than 5 cm) or T4 (invasion of chest wall or skin) are met.', 'For T4 classification, look for explicit mentions of chest wall invasion or ulceration of the skin of the breast, or satellite nodules and edema (including peau d’orange) confined to the same breast. Involvement of the skin, such as with Paget’s disease, does not by itself qualify as T4 unless it meets these specific criteria.', 'Always prioritize tumor size as the primary factor for determining the T stage, adhering to the specific size ranges defined by the AJCC TNM system (e.g., T1a: 0.1 cm or less, T1b: more than 0.1 cm but not more than 0.5 cm, T1c: more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm).', ""When skin involvement is mentioned, such as ulceration, it is crucial to distinguish between cases that qualify as T4 due to direct extension to the chest wall or skin (including ulcers, except for those that are purely satellite nodules without direct extension) and those where such involvement does not meet the T4 criteria. In this case, the mention of multiple ulcerations of the skin might have misleadingly suggested a T4 classification, but the key factor is the tumor's size and whether the skin involvement meets specific criteria for T4 classification, such as direct extension or significant skin involvement beyond satellite nodules."", 'When assessing the T stage, carefully distinguish between skin infiltration and skin ulceration. Skin infiltration without ulceration does not automatically classify as T4.', 'Always refer to the specific size criteria for T stages: T1 for tumors ≤2 cm, T2 for tumors >2 cm but ≤5 cm, and so on, as per the AJCC guidelines.', 'Always consider both the size of the tumor and its extent when determining the T stage, including any involvement of adjacent structures like the skin or chest wall.', 'For tumors larger than 5 cm, classify them as T3 unless there is evidence of skin or chest wall involvement, in which case they would be classified as T4.', 'Note that nipple-areolar complex involvement by itself does not automatically classify a tumor as T4; consider the overall size and extent of the tumor.', 'Carefully review the pathology report for any mention of skin changes, chest wall involvement, or other factors that could affect T staging beyond just the tumor size.']"

However, the size of the tumor is determined by the largest dimension of the invasive component, not the overall area of involvement. Since the largest dimension of the invasive tumor is 4.2 cm, we can rule out T1 (tumors ≤ 2 cm) and T4 (tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin). The tumor size falls into the T2 category (tumors > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm). There is no evidence of skin involvement or chest wall involvement, which would be required for a T4 classification.

Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochernical stainings support the. above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted. by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the. sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re-. review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic. tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla,. not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch. preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further. bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled. 1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan. probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x. 1. cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty. replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely. fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section. analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely as follows: 3FS- lymph node half, frozen section. 3A- remaining lymph node halves. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted. entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""left total mastectomy long lateral. short superior"". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x. 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan. skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm. retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The. specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined slightly stellate mass (ring-. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer. quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0. x. 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the. skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the. mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is. dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses. are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately. 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue. 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect). 5D-5K-fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G= posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior. aspect. 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect, 5P-5S= anterior. aspect. 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass. 5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AC- lower outer quadrant. 5AD- lower inner quadrant. 5AE- upper inner quadrant. 5AF-upper outer quadrant. Block 1-left breast tumor infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Block 2-left breast normal fibrocystic changes. Upper outer quadrant- green. Lower outer quadrant- red. Upper inner quadrant- black. Lower inner quadrant- blue. Anterior- orange. Cold ischemic time: 28 minutes. Formalin exposure time: 12 hours 30 minutes. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION.

Received fresh labeled ""left breast"" is a 1,184-gram simple mastectomy specimen (27.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm) with. a. stitch on the axillary tail. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin (15.0 x 10.5 cm) with a 1. cm centrally located, partially flattened nipple and 3.5 cm areola rim. The skin surface is remarkable for a grey-white,. well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1 cm that is 8.0 cm from the nipple. The specimen is inked. and serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 14 being most lateral. The. nipple is located in slice 8. The cut surface reveals a grey-white, firm, stellate mass (6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm) located in. the upper central and upper outer quadrants and present in slices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This mass measures 1.5 cm. from all margins. A second lesion is located in the 7 o'clock position (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in slice 6. Lesion #2 is. located 0.6 cm from lesion #1, and measures 1.5 cm from the closest inferior margin. An ill-defined nodular area.

Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for. (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

Block used. B20. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT.

Final Review: Pathologist. Final: Pathologist, 0. Amendment: Pathologist,. Amendment Review: Pathologist,. Amendment Final: Pathologis. Addendum: Pathologist,. Addendum Final: Patholoy.",True,"To determine the T stage of the breast cancer, we need to consider the size and extent of the tumor. According to the AJCC TNM classification system, the T stage is based on the largest dimension of the invasive tumor. The pathology report describes a multifocal invasive ductal carcinoma with the largest tumor measuring 6.0 cm in size, located in the upper central and upper outer quadrants. There are also smaller lesions, but the main tumor is the one that determines the T stage. Since the tumor is larger than 5 cm, it falls into the T3 category. The fact that the tumor is multifocal and has multiple smaller lesions does not change the T stage, as the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. Additionally, the report mentions that the tumor spans at least 6 cm, which further supports the T3 classification.",T3,,,

The T stage is primarily based on the size of the tumor. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:",T2,True,"Upon reviewing the provided pathology report and the actual ground truth T stage (T1), it appears that the divergence in reasoning occurred due to an incorrect interpretation of the tumor size. The report mentions the main tumor mass measuring 1.5 cm, but it also describes the tumor as multifocal with additional scattered foci of invasive lobular carcinoma. However, for the purpose of T staging, the AJCC guidelines specify that the size of the tumor should be based on the largest dimension of the invasive component. In multifocal tumors, if the foci are clearly separate, the largest dimension of the largest focus is used. The report does indicate that the tumor is multifocal but still provides a size measurement of the main tumor mass as 1.5 cm, which might have led to the incorrect assumption of a T2 classification (since T2 is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension).","['When determining the T stage, carefully evaluate the tumor size as reported in the pathology findings, considering both gross and microscopic measurements if provided.', 'Apply the AJCC TNM criteria strictly, where T2 is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, and T3 is defined as a tumor more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.', 'Always consider the possibility of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which would classify the tumor as T4, regardless of size.', 'Be aware of amendments or changes in the pathology report that may affect the T stage, such as changes in tumor size or the presence of additional tumor foci.', 'When determining the T stage, ensure that the tumor size is measured accurately and apply the AJCC criteria correctly: T1 corresponds to tumors 2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension.', 'Always verify that the reported tumor size aligns with the AJCC definitions for each T stage, considering the greatest dimension of the tumor.', 'Be aware of the specific AJCC criteria for T staging, including the distinctions between T1 (2.0 cm or less), T2 (more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm), T3 (more than 5.0 cm), and T4 (any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin).', 'When determining the T stage, consider not only the size of the invasive tumor but also its extent and relationship to the chest wall or skin.', 'For T3 tumors, the key criterion is the size of the tumor being more than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm in greatest dimension, or any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin, excluding the pectoralis muscle adherence.', 'Always carefully review the pathology report for descriptions of tumor size, location, and extension to accurately apply AJCC criteria.', 'When determining the T stage, focus on the size of the largest single focus of invasive carcinoma, not the cumulative size of all lesions or the size of in situ components.', 'For multicentric cancers (multiple separate foci of cancer in different quadrants of the breast), the T stage is determined by the largest single invasive carcinoma focus, regardless of the number of foci.', 'When determining the T stage, consider not only the size of the primary tumor but also its extension to adjacent structures such as the skin or chest wall.', 'The presence of skin ulcerations or satellite nodules should be carefully evaluated as these can affect the T stage classification, potentially upgrading it to a higher stage such as T4.', 'Always refer to the latest AJCC TNM staging manual for the most current criteria and guidelines, as updates can impact staging classifications.', 'When determining the T stage, prioritize the tumor size as the primary factor unless specific criteria for T3 (more than 5 cm) or T4 (invasion of chest wall or skin) are met.', 'For T4 classification, look for explicit mentions of chest wall invasion or ulceration of the skin of the breast, or satellite nodules and edema (including peau d’orange) confined to the same breast.

One lymph node, bisected. 3. Three lymph nodes submitted in toto.",True,"To determine the T stage of the breast cancer, we need to consider the size and extent of the primary tumor. According to the AJCC TNM classification system, the T stage is based on the greatest dimension of the invasive carcinoma. The pathology report states that the greatest dimension of the largest focus of invasion is 7.5 cm. This size corresponds to a T2 or T3 classification, as T2 is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, and T3 is defined as a tumor more than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Since the tumor is 7.5 cm, which is more than 5 cm, it falls into the T3 category. Additionally, the report mentions that the invasive tumor is focally present less than 0.1 cm from the anterior/skin margin and less than 0.1 cm from the deep posterior margin, but this information is more relevant to margin status than to the T stage itself. The presence of skin invasion, such as ulceration or fixation to the chest wall, would indicate a T4 classification, but the report does not describe such findings; instead, it mentions that the invasive carcinoma directly invades into the dermis without skin ulceration, which still supports a T3 classification rather than T4. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor (7.5 cm), the predicted T stage is T3.",T3,,,

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

END OF REPORT-.",True,"To determine the T stage of the breast cancer, we need to assess the size of the tumor. According to the AJCC TNM classification system, the T stage is based on the largest dimension of the invasive tumor. The pathology report mentions three masses measuring 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm in maximum dimension. Since the largest dimension of the invasive tumor is 2.0 cm, which is less than 5 cm, we can rule out T3 and T4. Now, we need to decide between T1 and T2. The report does not mention any skin or chest wall involvement, which is a characteristic of T4. The report also does not mention the tumor being greater than 5 cm, which would be T3. The largest tumor is 2.0 cm, and there are other smaller tumors, but the report does not indicate that the tumors are confluent or that their combined size would exceed 5 cm. However, the report does mention that lesions 2 and 3 are ""grossly connected"" in slice 5, suggesting that these two tumors may be considered as one for the purpose of sizing. Lesion 2 is 2.0 cm and lesion 3 is 1.9 cm, but since they are connected, their combined size is not simply additive for T staging purposes in this context. Instead, we focus on the largest dimension of the invasive tumor, which remains 2.0 cm for lesion 2, and the presence of other tumors does not change the T stage based on size alone. Therefore, based on the size of the largest tumor being less than 5 cm and greater than 2 cm (considering the largest single dimension provided), the predicted T stage would be T2.",T2,True,"The reasoning diverged from the correct reasoning when it considered the size of the largest tumor (2.0 cm) and incorrectly concluded that since it was greater than 2 cm, the T stage would be T2.

However, for the T stage, we focus on the invasive component. The presence of a satellite lesion is considered, but the size of the satellite lesion itself does not directly contribute to the T stage unless it is part of a multifocal or multicentric tumor. In this case, the satellite lesion is relatively small (0.7 cm) and separate from the main tumor, but its presence indicates a multifocal tumor. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest invasive tumor. Since the largest dimension of the invasive tumor (index lesion) is 2.0 cm, and considering the satellite lesion does not significantly alter the overall size classification in this context, we classify the tumor based on its size.",T1,,,

According to the AJCC TNM classification system, the T stage is based on the largest dimension of the invasive carcinoma. The pathology report mentions that the largest focus of invasive carcinoma measures 1.3cm. However, it also mentions that the DCIS spans the entire specimen, which is 8cm in greatest dimension. Since DCIS is not considered when determining the T stage, we only consider the size of the invasive carcinoma. The report also mentions that the entire mass, including both calcified areas, has a largest dimension of 5 cm. However, this measurement seems to include both the invasive carcinoma and the DCIS. Given that the largest focus of invasive carcinoma is 1.3cm, and there are multiple foci, we need to consider if the total size of the invasive carcinoma exceeds 5cm. The report does not provide a clear measurement of the total size of the invasive carcinoma, but it does mention that the main mass, which includes the invasive carcinoma, measures 3.5 X 2.5 X 2 cm. This suggests that the total size of the invasive carcinoma is likely less than 5cm. Based on the information provided, the largest dimension of the invasive carcinoma is 1.3cm for the largest focus, but the total size of the invasive carcinoma is not clearly stated.
