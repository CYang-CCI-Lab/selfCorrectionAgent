Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.

The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions. of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5 X 5 X 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions.

LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY received fresh labeled with the patient's name. and designated ""LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY"" is a piece of fatty tissue, 8. 0 x. 5.0 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm, impaled with a needle localization wire. The specimen. is oriented with sutures (short=superior, long=lateral) and is inked as. follows: Red=medial and lateral, blue=superior, green=inferior,. yellow=anterior, black=posterior. The needle localization wire enters the. specimen at the lateral margin. The tip of the wire is embedded in the mid. portion of the specimen. The accompanying specimen radiograph is reviewed. and shows numerous calcifications in the area of the wire localization. The specimen is serially sectioned, medial to lateral, revealing a poorly. differentiated mass, 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, corresponding to the. area of radiographic abnormality. The mass is firm and nodular, and. contains at least two vell-circumscribed masses with a tan, gritty cut. surface. The largest of these well-circumscribed - masses measures 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension. The 3.0 cm mass abuts the superior and inferior. margins. The remaining tissue is variably fatty and fibrous; the fibrous. tissue is firm and nodular in some areas. Sections of tumor and grossly. normal fibrous tissue are harvested for the. rotocol.
