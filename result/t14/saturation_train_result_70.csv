Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and ""right sentinel node"" is a 3.5. x. 2.5 x 2.0 cm portion of yellow. lobulated adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have a. flattened, 2.6 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm nodular, fatty lymph node. The node is sectioned. perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol. cassettes A1-A3. B. Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ""right breast"" is. a 962 gram. 23.0 x 20.0 x 4.5 cm fibrofatty breast consistent with simple mastectomy. specimen. There is a suture designating the region of the axilla and an overlying 12.5 x. 4.5 cm black-brown skin ellipse. The skin ellipse has a central, 5. 0 x 4.5 cm areola which. extends to the skin margins and a central 1.3 cm erect nipple. The deep margin is. predominantly smooth and intact with a focal. minor, inferior medial area of disruption. The deep margin will be inked blue and the breast is serially sectioned to have a diffusely. fatty parenchyma. The upper inner quadrant has a 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm tumor mass. The. mass. is 2.5 cm from the superior peripheral margin. The. is 17 cm from the inferior. peripheral margin, is approximately 4 cm from the medial peripheral margin and at least. 16.5 cm from the lateral peripheral margin. The tumor comes to within 0.7 cm of the deep. margin. The remainder of the breast has glistening, yellow adipose with diffuse. delicate. and focal scant dense-white fibrous tissue. There is a central area of possible fibrocystic. change. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 15 and 20% of the parenchyma and is more. pronounced towards the medial aspect of the breast. No additional indurated lesions. or. tumor-like masses are identified. Representative sections are sampled as labeled. B1. perpendicular section of nipple.

Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therans insidered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. Microscopic/Diagnostic DictationPathologist,.
