H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested. Drs. and. have reviewed selected stides form this case and. concur with the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed by manual. morphometry on block F3. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed. that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All. carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of. immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. HER2/neu.

Comment: Three distinct masses were identified in the mastectomy. specimen, all located in the lower outer quadrant. The two larger masses. (#1 and #2) are histologically similar, showing a poorly differentiated. epithelial component as well as a mesenchymal component displaying marked. pleomorphism and fascicles of spindled cells. Staining of these biphasic. areas show strong pancytokeratin positivity in the epithelial component. while the spindled areas are negative. The histologic and. immunohistochemical pattern is consistent with metaplastic carcinoma. with a malignant sarcomatous component (carcinosarcoma) . While. mass. #1. and #2 are morphologically similar, they are not grossly or histologically. contiguous. The third mass (#3) is a different histologic type (adenoid. cystic carcinoma) It is also grossly separate from masses #1 and #2. As. per the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the grade and stage of multiple tumors. of different histologic grade and/or type is based on the largest tumor.

Sectioning reveals two pink-tan lymph. nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. Each lymph. node is trisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface that is otherwise. unremarkable. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows. A1: first described lymph node. A2: second described lymph node. B. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. designated ""Right Axillary Sentinel Node #3"" and. consists of a pink-gray lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is trisected to reveal an unremarkable cut surface. The. specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. è designated ""Right Breast"" and consists of a right. mastectomy oriented with a short stitch superior and long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 21.0 cm from medial to lateral, 21.0 cm from. superior to inferior and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly. pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 6.2 x 4.5 cm and displays a. centrally located everted nipple measuring 1.0 cm in diameter. No. discharge is noted. No scars are noted. The specimen is inked as. follows: deep margin = black. superior surface of the lower outer quadrant = blue.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. This modified radial mastectomy specimen contains two. foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The larger is in the. mid-medial portion measuring 3.8 cm. The smaller one is in the. lower outer quadrant, 6.5 cm lateral to the larger tumor. Morphologically, they are quite similar and both of high grade. Between the tumors, lymphovascular space invasion is present without. parenchymal invasion. The smaller tumor is also associated with. high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. It is likely, therefore, that. these two foci represent separate primaries, even though there. remains a possibility that the smaller tumor is metastatic. Please. see the template below. The template incorporates the findings on. both of the tumors. Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Both tumors are poorly differentiated. Overall grade: Elston SBR grade 3. Architectural score: 3. Nuclear score: 3. Mitotic score: 3. Greatest dimension (pT) : The larger tumor measures 3.8 cm and. the smaller. measures 2 cm, pT2.
