External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue.

The results reported below are the. verbatim results of this referral. HER2 Amp. Breast Cancer. FISH. Specimen. Tissue-Paraffin. Specimen ID. Source. Left breast. Reason For Referral. r/o HER2 gene amplification. Fixative. Formalin. Method: FISH using probes for HER2 (17q12) and a chromosome 17 centromere (D17Z1) control probe. (PathVysion,. Two technologists score signals in 60 total nuclei from invasive or. metastatic tumor and concurrent controls. nuc ish (D17Z1x2, Her2x3-5). The HER2 to D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. Interpretation: The invasive tumor nuclei have an amplified HER2D17Z1 ratio (per ASCO/CAP. The HER2D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. In our opinion, this result may not. guidelines). reflect centromere true HER2 and amplification. 3-5 copies of Most the HER2 nuclei gene. have 2 This copies result of the indicates chromosome the. 17 tumor has. additional copies of the HER2 gene (i.e., duplication), but does not have sufficient. copies to suggest high level HER2 amplification. It is not known if HER2. duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Arch Path Lab Med 131:18-43, 2007). A HER2D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene amplification. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined. by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, It is intended as. an adjunct to existing prognostic clinical and pathologic information for breast cancer. patients. This test is not intended to diagnose or screen for breast cancer. Per ASCO/. CAP guidelines, HER2FISH test results are valid for non-decalcified paraffin embedded. specimens fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin between 6 and 48 hours.
