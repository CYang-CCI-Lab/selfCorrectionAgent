HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

Comment: : This case is amended. to add the results of. immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, as. noted above. No other changes are made. Although ER and PR stains were previously performed on the patient's core. biopsy. they were repeated due the greater number of. neoplastic cells in the current specimen and due to the focal staining for. progesterone receptors (reportedly 1%) in the prior biopsy. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were evaluated by immunohistochemical. methods (. estrogen receptor antibody 1D5, progesterone receptor. antibody PgR636) A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear. staining in 1% or more of the tumor cells.

The darkly. pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 15.5 x 5.5 cm and displays a. 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm centrally located, everted nipple, free of discharge. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a fairly well defined, firm pink-tan mass in the. upper outer quadrant. The mass measures 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm, comes to. within 0.4 cm of the deep margin and abuts the superficial margin.

A 1.2 x 1. 2 x. 0.5. cm. ell-circumscribed, rubbery fibrous nodule is noted in the lower mid. breast which is consistent with a fibroadenoma. The remainder of the. specimen is composed of markedly dense tan-white fibrous tissue with. minimal admixed adipose tissue. No additional lesions are identified.

The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate. that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The ""N"" stage has thus been. corrected to pN1, as well.

The deep fascial plane is inked black, the. remaining superior half is inked blue with the remaining inferior half. inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. A gray-white, firm, irregularly-bordered mass is identified in the. upper outer quadrant measuring 3.2 X 2.2 X 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. This mass is consistent with a bilobed single mass. However, it could. represent two separate masses. The central area of the mass is. submitted which could represent normal parenchyma in between the two. masses. The mass is 1.8 cm to the deep margin and 2.5 cm to the nipple. A dumbbell-shaped biopsy clip is identified near the medial portion of. the mass. There are firm, indurated possibly calcified areas located. posteriorly to the nipple. The axillary tail is dissected to reveal 19. potential lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.6 cm in greatest. dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted.
