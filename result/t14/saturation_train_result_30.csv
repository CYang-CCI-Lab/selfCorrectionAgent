ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom HerceptinÂ® therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..

In Situ Component type/Architecture pattern: Ductal carcinoma in situ, comedo and solid subtypes. Lobular carcinoma in situ. In Situ Component nuclear grade: High grade (nuclear grade 3). In Situ Component necrosis: Present. In Situ Component extent/size: In situ carcinoma comprises less than 10% of. total tumor volume and is present in association with both masses as well as. being present in tissue between the masses. Extensive intraductal component: Not identified. Nipple involvement: Not identified. Skin involvement: Not identified. Margin status: Invasive component: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is less than 1 mm from. the deep specimen margin (see comment). In Situ component: Ductal carcinoma in situ is 3 mm from the deep specimen. margin. Axillary lymph nodes: Total number with metastasis: 4. Total number examined: 15. Size of largest metastasis: 9mm.

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a pMx. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum. Gross Description: Specimen A is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""left re-excision. posterior margin, tumor clip posterior"" and is a partially oriented 2.6 x 1.8 x. 1.0 cm fragment of mainly brown/red muscle with some minimal adherent. fibroadipose tissue. There is a clip on one surface indicating the margin. This. surface is inked blue. The remainder of the specimen is inked black. Sectioning exhibits unremarkable red/brown muscle with minimal fibroadipose. tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks A1. and A2.

The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor,. progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu immunohistochemical studies. Estrogen receptor (Ventana, clone SP1): Interpretation: POSITIVE. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 97%. Progesterone receptor (Ventana, clone 1E2): Interpretation: POSITIVE. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 27%. HER2/neu (. clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: INDETERMINATE. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 2+ (see comment). Site: Left breast. Performed on block: C3. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK. POSITIVE,. >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0, 1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE,. 3=POSITIVE FOR. OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show. appropriate staining. The patient' S larger tumor was sampled and tested previously, which showed a similar. pattern of immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu. Subsequent in situ. hybridization studies for HER-2/neu gene amplification on that specimen showed that the. tumor was positive for Her-2/neu gene amplification. In situ hybridization studies can be. repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as. analyte specific reagents (ASR) or research use only (RUO) reagents. These were. developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not. been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA. has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests. are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational. or for research.
