There is moderate nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline.

The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There isstrong nuclear staining in 90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate nuclear staining in 60% of tumor. cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is positive for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block F8 using the CB11. monocional antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

COMMENT: Hormone receptor and HER2 studies previously reported. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old female with breast carcinoma, left. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LEFT BRFAST MASTECTOMY received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated ""LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS"" consists. of a 1,044.0 gram modified radical mastectomy specimen. It measures 20.5. cm medial to lateral, 20.0 cm superior to inferior, 4.5 cm anterior to. posterior, with an attached axillary tail, 11.0 x 7.0 x 3.7 cm, and an. overlying ellipse of nipple bearing skin, measuring 18. x 9.5 cm. The. nipple is inverted and the skin is otherwise unremarkable. Ink code: Blue=superior superficial, green=inferior superficial, black=deep. Sectioning reveals a poorly defined, indurated mass in the upper inner. quadrant focally abutting the deep margin. Continuous with this lesion and. extending laterally to the outer portion of the breast is a broad area of. Specimen # : GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued). variably indurated fibrous tissue (overall maximum dimension of mass plus. indurated fibrous tissue = 9.0 cm) . Multiple sections are harvested for. the. protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows : A1: Skin (medial tip). A2: Lymph node, 1.8 cm, mid/upper axillary tail. A3: Tumor, upper inner quadrant. A4: Indurated fibrous tissue (5.0 cm from medial extent of tumor). central. A5: Indurated fibrous tissue (7.0 cm from medial extent of tumor) ,. central. A6: Indurated fibrous tissue (9.0 cm from medial extent of tumor) ,. mid center. A7: Grossly normal fibrofatty tissue, lower outer quadrant. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals 14 possible lymph nodes. ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Additional. representative sections are submitted in cassettes A8 through A22, as. follows: A8: Nipple. A9-A11: Mass upper inner quadrant . A12: Centralized fibrous area. Al3: Upper inner quadrant. A14: Lower inner quadrant. A15: Lower outer quadrant. A16: Upper outer quadrant. A17: Five possible lymph nodes. A18: Five possible lymph nodes. A19: Two possible lymph nodes, largest lymph node bisected and submitted. in its entirety. A20: One lymph node bisected and submitted in its entirety. A21-A22: One lymph node bisected and submitted in its entirety in two. cassettes. 22CF.",BRCA,0,"The report states that the size of the tumor is 9 cm, which falls within the T3 category (tumor size > 5 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the tumor, without considering the presence of lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion. The T stage is based on the pathological measurement of the tumor size, not the gross measurement. The T stage may be determined by the presence of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, but the report does not mention any such extension.",T3,57.0
