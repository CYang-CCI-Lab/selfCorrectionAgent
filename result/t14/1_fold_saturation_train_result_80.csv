GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a single formalin-filled container labeled with the patient's name. 'right breast, tie marks sentinel node' and. consists of a 281.8 gram, 20.0 x 11.5 x 3.8 cm mastectomy specimen partially surfaced by a 15.8 x 7.5 cm ellipse of pink-tan wrinkled skin bearing an. eccentric 0.9 x 0.8 cm inverted nipple. A suture is present at the lateral edge and denotes the sentinel lymph node. A discrete axillary tail is not identified. The. deep. margin. is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 5.3 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm ilf-defined gray-white mass originating centrally subjacent. to the nipple and abutting the skin surface at the nipple. This mass approaches to within 0.7 cm of the inked deep margin. The uninvolved tissue is. comprised of yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed with minimal amounts of interspersed gray-white fibrous tissue. Focal areas of nodularity are present at. the medial and lateral borders, however, discrete invasive mass is not identified. The closest of these nodules approaches to within 1.5 cm of the inked. margin. Adjacent to the aforementioned suture, denotes a 2.0 cm well delineated nodule consistent with lymph node. Within the adjacent fibroadipose tissue are. two additional firm fatty nodules consistent with lymph node, 0.5 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%.

INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS. Test. Description. Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report. Any negative Her2 IHC result. without optimal fixation time should have Her2 FISH testing. performed. FISH, HER2/neu refl to IHC: CYTOGENETIC RESULTSCylogenetic. Reference #: Test Setup Date: est.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled left breast complete mastectomy and is received in formalin. It consists of a. mastectomy specimen which weighs 227 grams. A black suture with a metallic clip marks the ""tail of the. breast"". With this orientation the specimen measures 18.5 cm from medial to lateral, 11.8 cm from. superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm superficial to deep. There is an overlying broad ellipse of dark brown skin. which measures 17 x 6.5 cm. Centrally and slightly superiorly within the skin is a 2.3 cm areola and a. protuberant 0.7 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked. green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and centrally located. tan-white fibrous parenchyma. There are no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance. suggestive of neoplasm. In the lateral portion of the specimen, 2 cm from the lateral edge, there is a. circumscribed 0,7 cm pale red lymph node. Representative sections are submitted, Section summary: A1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple,. A2) representative upper inner quadrant,. A3) representative lower inner quadrant,.

The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. It. consists of a mastectomy specimen together with axillary ussue weighing 292 grams. The breast measures. 16 cm from medial to lateral, 9 cm from superior to inferior and up to 4 cm from superficial to deep. There. is an overlying ellipse of dark brown skin which measures 15.5 x 7.6 cm. Slightly medially located within. the skin is a circumscribed 2,5 cm areola and a protuberant 0,6 cm nipple, The skin is unremarkable. Axillary tissue is present and measures 15 x 6.5 X 1.8 cm. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. auterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth facial tissue, is. inked black. in the central lateral portion of the deep margin, there is a 3 x 0,5 cm band of skeletal muscle. which is indicated by the surgeon as pectoralis major behind the tumor. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a relatively well-circumscribed. firm,. tan-white tumor mass beginning directly underneath the nipple and extending laterally within the breast. This tumor mass measures 4,7 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 em from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm from. superticial to deep. This neoplasm is 3.5 cm from the closest medial margin, 5 cm from the axillary tail,. 2.5 cm from the closest superior margin, and 2.2 cm from the closest inferior margin. Centrally, it is grossly. 0.2 cm from the closest deep margin and does not appear to extend into the small strip of pectoralis. muscle. The remainder of the breast is composed of soft fatty tissue without other palpable masses. Representative tumor and adjacent breast parenchyma are obtained for research purposes. In the medial. portion of the axillary tail, there is a prominent firm 1.5 cm lymph node suspicious for metastatic. involvement. Representative tissue from this lymph node is obtained for research purposes also. The. axillary tissue is dissected for nodes. Representaitve sections are submitted.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative. blocks of axillary. lymph nodes (C6 and C7) and the results are as follows: CD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular. distribution. CD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of. the paracortex. Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

The tumor mass blends into the adjacent thick fibrotic tissue. The. tumor comes to within 1.0 cm of the medial margin. 0.2 cm of the lateral. margin. 2.0 cm of the superior margin, 0.7 cm of the inferior margin. 1.5 cm. of the skin and nipple, and abuts the posterior margin. The reinaining cut. surface is composed of approximately 50% adipose tissue and 50% fibrous. tissue. A biopsy cavity or metallic clip is not found. Representative. sections are sequentially submitted, from medial to lateral. in six cassettes. as follows: cassette 1 - medial margin; cassette 2 - nipple with anterior. aspect: cassette 3 - tumor mass with closest posterior margin; cassette 4 -. tumor mass with superior margin; cassette 5 - tumor mass with inferior margin;. cassette 6 - tumor mass with lateral margin. C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-yellow fatty tissue. measuring 5 X 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 X 0.3 x. 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 X 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest. lymph node shows foci of tan-gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely. submitted in four cassettes as follows cassette 1 - one intact and one. bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node: cassette 3 - two bisected. lymph nodes (one inked black): cassette 4 - largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A & APC. One slide is examined for each portion of the case. Both slides. demonstrate extensive lymph node involvement by poorly differentiated. carcinoma. Because of the obvious nature of this finding, it will not be. necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain. B/BPC. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without. evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of. tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy. ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3. shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of. lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-lik areas and numerous foci of. ""Indian file"" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1. mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of. tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli. and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically. active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present. within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this. lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows. no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear. inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site dre. also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6. C. Four slides are examined. These show six lymph nodes. Positive lymph. Not for Permanent Slorage in Medical Records / Not Valid for Signing. Date of Service. Performing Facility. Result Provider.

A suture designates the axillary aspect. of the spacimen. Identified on the anterior surface is a light tan skin. ellipse measuring 24 x 12 cm. No scars are identified on the epidermal. surface. A grossly unremarkable nipple measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm is. identified. The entire deep resection margin is inked. Identified on the. deep aspect is a 6 x 2.5 x 2 cm defect near the axillary aspect of the. specimen. Serial sections through the specimen reveal two distinct tumor. masses in the lower inner quadrant and one separate tumor mass between the. lower inner and lower outer quadrants. The two masses in the lower inner. quadrant are fairly well-circumscribed. firm, spiculated with focal areas of. necrosis and measure 2 x 1 x 1 cm and 1.3 x 1 x 1 cm. The larger tumor mass. is at a distance of 4 em from the closest deep resection margin and 2 cm. from the closest superficial resection margin, The smaller tumor mass in. the lower inner quadrant is at a distance of 5 cm from the closest deep. resection margin and 4 cm from the closest anterior resection margin. The. tumor mass located between the lower inner and lower outer quadrants is. well-circumseribed, firm, tan and measures 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 en and in located. at a distance of 5 em from the closest deep resection margin. The remainder. of the parenchyma is comprised of approximately 5% tan-white fibrous tissue. and 95% yellow-tan adipose tissue. A portion of the largest tumor is. submitted for TPS studies.

According to the rules provided, T2 category is for tumors that are greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm in size. However, the rule also specifies that the T stage is determined solely by the size of the tumor, and the largest focus in this case is 1.8 cm, which falls under T1c category (tumors that are greater than 1 cm but less than or equal to 2 cm in size). But, since the report mentions multiple foci, we need to consider the largest focus of invasive carcinoma which is 1.8 cm, hence the T stage is T2.",T2,74.0
