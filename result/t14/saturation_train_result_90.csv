MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. This modified radial mastectomy specimen contains two. foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The larger is in the. mid-medial portion measuring 3.8 cm. The smaller one is in the. lower outer quadrant, 6.5 cm lateral to the larger tumor. Morphologically, they are quite similar and both of high grade. Between the tumors, lymphovascular space invasion is present without. parenchymal invasion. The smaller tumor is also associated with. high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. It is likely, therefore, that. these two foci represent separate primaries, even though there. remains a possibility that the smaller tumor is metastatic. Please. see the template below. The template incorporates the findings on. both of the tumors. Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Both tumors are poorly differentiated. Overall grade: Elston SBR grade 3. Architectural score: 3. Nuclear score: 3. Mitotic score: 3. Greatest dimension (pT) : The larger tumor measures 3.8 cm and. the smaller. measures 2 cm, pT2.

COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc. bllowing the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

There is a broad overlying semi-circular portion of tan skin measuring 23 x 14.5 cm. In the medial. inferior edge of the skin, there is a 4.5 cm areola with a protuberant 1.4 cm nipple. The skin is otherwise. unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and. the posterior margin, which partially consists of smooth facial appearing tissue, is inked black. The. specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white. fibrous parenchyma. In the central inferior portion of the breast, along the superior medial edge of the. areola, there is an area of fibrous parenchyma which has a slightly stellate appearance but is soft and. rubbery. This stellate area is 2 cm in maximum dimension. It is 4 cm or greater from the deep, inferior,. and superior margin and is 2 cm from the closest skin. The breast parenchyma in the lower outer quadrant. has a rough fine nodular feel but there are no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance.

Comment: Three distinct masses were identified in the mastectomy. specimen, all located in the lower outer quadrant. The two larger masses. (#1 and #2) are histologically similar, showing a poorly differentiated. epithelial component as well as a mesenchymal component displaying marked. pleomorphism and fascicles of spindled cells. Staining of these biphasic. areas show strong pancytokeratin positivity in the epithelial component. while the spindled areas are negative. The histologic and. immunohistochemical pattern is consistent with metaplastic carcinoma. with a malignant sarcomatous component (carcinosarcoma) . While. mass. #1. and #2 are morphologically similar, they are not grossly or histologically. contiguous. The third mass (#3) is a different histologic type (adenoid. cystic carcinoma) It is also grossly separate from masses #1 and #2. As. per the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the grade and stage of multiple tumors. of different histologic grade and/or type is based on the largest tumor.

Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1. (lymph node). The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."".

Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis.

There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.

[tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3, Nottingham score 8/9], forming a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm mass. [AJCC pTlc]. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, comprising less than 5% of. tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. Biopsy site changes present. All surgical. resection margins, after re-excisions of the medial and superior margins, are negative for tumor. (minimum tumor free margin, 0.9 cm, superior margin). A single intramammary lymph node,. present at the medial margin, is positive for metastatic carcinoma. The involved lymph node. measures 1.5 mm in maximum dimension. Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 2) left axillary lymph node is positive. for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]. Blue dye is identified in both left axillary sentinel lymph. nodes. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel. lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. Lymph nodes, left axillary, dissection: Multiple (36) left axillary lymph nodes are negative for. tumor. Faxitron done. Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-2/NEU have been ordered on paraffin. embedded tissue.",BRCA,1,"The report states that the size of the largest focus of the invasive carcinoma is 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm, which is less than or equal to 2 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to a T1 stage, and the presence of necrosis, associated in situ component, or margin status does not affect this stage.",T1,84.0
