830,TCGA-AQ-A1H2.1B5FA34B-E3B4-4D4B-AF0A-1C90016CC532,1,"SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVISED REPORT. Diagnosis: Breast, right, mastectomy. Tumor type: invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive fibrosis (see comment). Nottingham combined histologic grade: 2. Tubule formation score: 2. Nuclear Pleomorphism Score: 3. Mitotic count score: 2. Focality of tumor: single focus. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.5 cm (see comment). Lymphovascular invasion: present (A8). In Situ Component: present. In Situ Component type/Architecture pattern: solid and cribriform. In Situ Component nuclear grade: 3. In Situ Component necrosis: none identified. In Situ Component extent/size: DCIS is present with tumor and focally away from tumor. Size is approximately 6 mm. Extensive intraductal component: Absent. The DCIS comprises approximately 2% of total tumor. Nipple involvement: none identified. Skin involvement: none identified. Margin status: nvasive component: >5 mm. in Situ component: >5 mm. Axillary lymph nodes: Total number with metastasis: 7. Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below). Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15). Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue. Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis. Other findings: - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Benign skeletal muscle. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to. change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%. Progesterone receptor (. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 12%. HER2/neu (Ventana, clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Negative (not overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 1+. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A7. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show appropriate staining. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR) or. research use only (RUO) reagents. These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not been cleared or. approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not. necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Resident Physician: Attending Pathologist: I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have. rendered the above diagnosis(es). Procedures/Addenda: Addendum. Addendum. The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. immunohistochemical studies. Estrogen receptor (1. 1, clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 94%. Progesterone receptor t. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Negative. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 0%. HER2/neu (. clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Positive (overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 3+ (see note). NOTE: This block (A5) includes areas that show morphologies similar to both the superficial and deep cores. ER and PR are. relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor, regardless of morphology. Immunostain for HER2 is heterogeneous, but. staining does not correlate with any particular morphology. There is enough strong complete staining to interpret the. HER2 as 3+ (overexpressed); however, areas in this block range from no staining to strong and complete staining. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A5. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin.

No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1H (left segmental mastectomy @ 2:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, this specimen is. not amplified. Although amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene. and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The. average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was. 2.44. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.

POSITIVE ( > 90%). Progesterone receptor. PgR 636. POSITIVE (1-10%). HER-2/neu (c-erb-B2). NEGATIVE 0. B. HOT SPOT #1, AXILLA I, CT-xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic. carcinoma (block B): Keratin: NEGATIVE (see note). Note: A single cell that appears to be keratin positive is present in the subcapsular space. However, the nuclear size. and morphology of this cell is different than the primary tumor cells. Selected slides were reviewed with Dr. XX and. concurs with the diagnosis. C. HOT SPOT #1, AXILLAI CT -xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic. carcinoma (C): Keratin: NEGATIVE. Interpretation Guidelines: For hormone receptor immunohistochemical analysis, the percent of immunoreactive. nuclei in the invasive or in-situ carcinoma is assessed manually by light microscopic examination and reported as. follows: Positive: greater than or equal to 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive. Negative: less than 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive. Non-neoplastic mammary epithelial cells are immunoreactive for estrogen and progesterone receptors (internal. control). For HER2/neu immunohistochemical analysis, the cell membrane staining is assessed manually by light microscopic. examination. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity alone is scored as a negative result.

B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the -. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu. /CEP17. Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. interpretation di the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.).

A11- random sections, upper inner quadrant. A12- random sections, upper outer quadrant. A13-14- small tumor in lower outer quadrant (lesion #3) . A15- additional sections, lower outer quadrant. ESE. A16- lower inner quadrant. The attached axillary tail measures 12 x 6 x 3 cm. Within this, multiple. lymph nodes are identified; at least two nodes appear grossly involved with. tumor. 1 of 4. A17- single 3 cm lymph node, grossly positive (a portion of this lymph node is. submitted to Tissue Bank) . A18- multiple lower level axillary lymph node candidates. A19- single lower level axillary lymph node, bisected. A20- single large mid axillary lymph node, bisected. A21- multiple mid axillary lymph nodes. A22- distal axillary lymph nodes. Note: A portion of tumor number one, skin, and grossly positive lymph node. tissue have all been submitted to the Tissue Bank.

Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant. B8- random sections, upper inner quadrant. B9- random sections, lower inner quadrant. B10-random sections, lower outer quadrant. There is no definite axillary tail attached to the specimen. There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.
