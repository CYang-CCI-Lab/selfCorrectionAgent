Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."". Sections through the remainder of the breast shows firm fibrous breast. parenchyma but no additional discrete masses. Sections are submitted as. follows: A1- nipple and areola and incision site with grossly apparent tumor (lesion. #2). A2-A4- sections of biopsy site with surrounding induration (lesion #2). A5- tangential sections of margin deep to lesion #2. A6-A8- sections through lesion #1 (closest approach of tumor to superior. margin in A8.).

A11- random sections, upper inner quadrant. A12- random sections, upper outer quadrant. A13-14- small tumor in lower outer quadrant (lesion #3) . A15- additional sections, lower outer quadrant. ESE. A16- lower inner quadrant. The attached axillary tail measures 12 x 6 x 3 cm. Within this, multiple. lymph nodes are identified; at least two nodes appear grossly involved with. tumor. 1 of 4. A17- single 3 cm lymph node, grossly positive (a portion of this lymph node is. submitted to Tissue Bank) . A18- multiple lower level axillary lymph node candidates. A19- single lower level axillary lymph node, bisected. A20- single large mid axillary lymph node, bisected. A21- multiple mid axillary lymph nodes. A22- distal axillary lymph nodes. Note: A portion of tumor number one, skin, and grossly positive lymph node. tissue have all been submitted to the Tissue Bank. Per the surgeon, ER/PR. analyses have already been performed, and therefore no additional tissue is. banked for receptor analysis. B. ""Right breast and axillary contents"", fresh. Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant. B8- random sections, upper inner quadrant. B9- random sections, lower inner quadrant. B10-random sections, lower outer quadrant. There is no definite axillary tail attached to the specimen. There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen. Papillomas are present in adjacent breast tissue. DIAGNOSIS: A. ""LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA"": LEFT BREAST WITH THREE SEPARATE FOCI OF BREAST CARCINOMA.

The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.
