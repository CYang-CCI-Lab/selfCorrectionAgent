The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes.

Received fresh is a 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm fragment of golden yellow fibroadipose tissue containing one rubbery. partially fat-replaced 1.1 x 1 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The node is bisected and submitted for frozen section in A1. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Lymph node, positive for metastatic breast carcinoma. B. Received fresh is a3x2x15 cm fragment of golden yellow fibroadipose tissue. Dissection reveals two. rubbery, partially fat-replaced nodes, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. Both nodes are bisected and. submitted for permanent section in B1 and B2. C. Received fresh are two fragments of lobular golden yellow fibroadipose tissue along with attached and. unattached smooth, unremarkable tan-red skin weighing 256 grams in aggregate and measuring from 5 x 3.4 x 2.2. cm to 16 x 11 x 3.5 cm. Sectioning reveals a cut surface consistent of lobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed. with fibrous pink-white breast parenchyma. Representative tissue is submitted in C1 - C2. D. Fixed in formalin for approximately 33 hours is a 1,215 gram modified radical mastectomy with the breast. proper measuring 20 cm from medial to lateral x 19.5 cm from superior to inferior x 7 cm from anterior to posterior. Dissection of the 11 x 6 x 4 cm axillary tail reveals several rubbery tan-red lymph nodes, 0,3 to 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. There is an 18 x 9 cm ellipse of tan-red skin on the anterior surface with a superomedial placed nipple. The. superior margin is inked black, inferior blue. medial green, lateral yellow and posterior red. The specimen is. serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17 slices measuring from 1 to 1.3 cm. In the upper outer quadrant. of. the breast is a large firm, multinodular, ill-defined 7 x 5 x 3.8 cm pink-gray mass which extends from the 9 to 11. o'clock position, 5-6 cm away from the nipple. This large, multinodular lesion appears grossly to come within 0.5. cm of the posterior margin, 1.5 cm of the superior margin and greater than 2 cm away from all remaining margins. in the upper inner quadrant of the breast at approximately the 2 o'clock position, 7-8 cm away from the nipple is a. smaller, firm, ill-defined 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm pink-gray mass located 1 cm away from the superior margin and greater. than 2 cm from all remaining margins. This mass appears grossly to be located 3.5 cm away from the larger lesion. The rest of the specimen consists of lobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed with fibrous pink-white breast. parenchyma. A photograph of slices 4 through 14 is taken to illustrate both lesions and their relationship to the. inked margins. Sections submitted are indicated on the photograph and are sublabeled D10-D25.

The first specimen submitted in the fresh state is labeled ""right breast tissue"" The. specimen is the right breast, total mastectomy specimen Suture marks the axillary tail of. the breast. There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5. cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position The overlying superficial margin. adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked. with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges. are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized In the center. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. À. portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to. within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 O'clock. at its closest point.
