Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue. Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis. Other findings: - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Benign skeletal muscle. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to. change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%. Progesterone receptor (. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 12%. HER2/neu (Ventana, clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Negative (not overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 1+. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A7. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved.

Grossing Pathologist: Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and. negative controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified. as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. Anatomic Pathology Department,. These reagents have not been cleared or. oproved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not. necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This. laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform. high complexity clinical laboratory testing. Resident Physician: Attending Pathologist: I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have. rendered the above diagnosis(es). Procedures/Addenda: Addendum. Addendum. The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. immunohistochemical studies. Estrogen receptor (1. 1, clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 94%. Progesterone receptor t. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Negative. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 0%. HER2/neu (. clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Positive (overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 3+ (see note). NOTE: This block (A5) includes areas that show morphologies similar to both the superficial and deep cores. ER and PR are. relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor, regardless of morphology. Immunostain for HER2 is heterogeneous, but. staining does not correlate with any particular morphology. There is enough strong complete staining to interpret the. HER2 as 3+ (overexpressed); however, areas in this block range from no staining to strong and complete staining. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A5. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show appropriate staining. Jome of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR) or. research use only (RUO) reagents. These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not. been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
