Fish Ordered: Yes on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1H (left segmental mastectomy @ 2:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, this specimen is. not amplified. Although amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene. and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The. average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was. 2.44. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.

Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochernical stainings support the. above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted. by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the. sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re-. review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic. tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla,. not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch. preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further. bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled. 1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan. probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x. 1. cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty. replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely. fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section. analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely as follows: 3FS- lymph node half, frozen section. 3A- remaining lymph node halves. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted. entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""left total mastectomy long lateral. short superior"". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x. 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan. skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm. retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The. specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined slightly stellate mass (ring-. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer. quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0. x. 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the. skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the. mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is. dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses. are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately. 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue. 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect). 5D-5K-fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G= posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior. aspect. 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect, 5P-5S= anterior. aspect. 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass. 5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AC- lower outer quadrant. 5AD- lower inner quadrant. 5AE- upper inner quadrant. 5AF-upper outer quadrant.

A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in the medical. literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance and. assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory. The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is. regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic. determined by the Department of Pathology Laboratory. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food. and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive and negative. controls. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: D11. ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3. PR: Positive Allred Score: 4 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score. 2. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score. (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of. cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate. intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako (. following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistocnemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 6 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 3 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. D11. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.29. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

It consists. of a 2.9 X 2.2 X 0.7 cm discoid lobulated portion of fatty tissue. On dissection a single 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. lymph node is recovered. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the. specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Medially and. inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The. breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area. of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral,. 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.
