Invasive adeno carcinoma of breast. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast biopsy (AF1)"". in formalin. The specimen consists of an. irregular ovoid fragment of firm pink and yellow-tan tissue measuring 2 x 1.5. x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen has been previously. submitted as frozen section AF1, and portion of tissue has been previously. submitted for ER/PR evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in. Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This is. located more centrally but in the lower outer quadrant. The larger firm mass. surrounding the biopsy cavity to within approximately 0.5 cm of the surgical. margin but the fibroadipose tissue on the deep surface is easily clear over. the lesions. Tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the superior surgical margin. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1-B2- representative sections of mass and adjacent biopsy cavity.

INTERPRETATION. nuc ish(D17Z1,ERBB2)x2-6[80]. No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu. / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer).

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

Sectioning of nipple shows dense fibrous tissue. with possible lesion involvement. Remainder of parenchyma is lobulated. yellow tan and fatty with scant fibrous tissue. No lymph nodes identified. Representative sections: A1: skin. A2: nipple. A3: mass (lateral portion). A4: mass and adjacent fibrous tissue (medial portion). Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued). A5: mid inner quadrant nodule with margins. A6: mass with deep margin (central). A7: upper outer quadrant. A8: lower outer quadrant. A9: lower inner quadrant. A10: upper inner quadrant . Matched sections of A1-A4 and A7-A10 are. submitted. for CBCP protocol. A11-A20 represent additional sections of mass. Remaining breast tissue is. unoriented, no sutures remain in tissue. Representative samples of lesion. beneath elliptical wedge of skin and nipple are represented. A13-A14. represent one match set. Specimen submitted. B. Received in formalin labeled with patient's name. labeled. ""RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS INCLUDING SARCO BUNDLE"" consists of an 11 x 6 x 3. cm irregular unoriented portion of fatty tissue. Sectioning reveals two. matted portions of soft tissue measuring 4 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and 8 x 4 x 1.2. cm. On sectioing the cut surfaces show dense indurated fibrotic tissue. with red tan lymphoid tissue noted along periphery of the smaller portion. tissue. Single intact discrete lymph node is identified and remaining. tissue which measures 0.6 cm. Exact number of lymph nodes cannot be. determined. Representative sections are as follows: B1-B3: smaller portion of tissue. B4-B6: larger portion of tissue. B7: one bisected lymph node.",BRCA,2,"The report states that the tumor size is 4.5 cm, which falls under the 'T4' category as per the rule 'T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin.' The report also mentions skin involvement, which further supports the 'T4' stage.",T4,56.0
