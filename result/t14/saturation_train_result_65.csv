Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.

On the anterior surface is a 18.0 X 8.0 cm tannish brown ellipse of skin with a. 4.0 X 4.5 cm areola and a 1.5 X 1.4 X 0.5 cm raised nipple. The nipple-areolar. complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or retraction. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue;. inferior edge - green;. posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to. reveal a rubbery, irregularly shaped, white-tan, 4.5 X 3.5 x 2.5 cm mass with. a. granular cut surface in slices 3 through 5. A clip is identified in slice 3. The. mass is 0.5 cm from the posterior margin and widely free (>2 cm) from the. anterior superior and anterior inferiormargins.

The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

Printed:",BRCA,2,"The report states that the tumor size is at least 65 mm (6.5 cm), which falls under the T3 category of tumor size being greater than 5.0 cm. The fact that there are two tumor masses that are connected by invasive lobular carcinoma further supports this classification, as the largest focus of invasive carcinoma is used to determine the T stage. The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ, skin invasion, and nipple invasion do not affect the T stage.",T3,56.0
