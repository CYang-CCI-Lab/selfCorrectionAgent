A twisted biopsy site clip is also embedded within this stellate mass. The central breast tissue has an ill-defined firm area measuring approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.

Calcifications within ductal carcinoma in situ. Procedure/Addenda for. ADDENDUM. Date of Addendum.: Addendum Comment. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed by manual. morphometry on block F3. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed. that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All. carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of. immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. HER2/neu.

Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 1/3,. mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9] is identified forming a mass (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm) located in. the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC pTlc]. This cancer shows HER2/neu protein. overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel. lymph node No. 1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible. by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision. below). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;. Nottingham score /9] is identified forming a second lesion (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) in the upper outer. quadrant located 0.6 cm inferior and medial to the first lobular carcinoma mass [AJCC pT1c]. This tumor also shows HER2/neu protein overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below). However, there is no morphologic evidence of metastasis by this second lesion into any of the. sentinel lymph nodes. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present within and outside the. invasive component with a separate nodule in the central/deep breast, 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, located. 1.4 cm medial to the infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Angiolymphatic invasion is not seen. The. non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes. are present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All. surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor. free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior/superior margin). Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 12) right axillary sentinel lymph. node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1 mi (sn)]. This positive sentinel node is. designated No. 1D (tissue block A4) and is characterized by a roughly 1.1 mm collection of. keratin positive tumor cells without much in the way of H&E morphologic correlation. As noted. above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary. sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (verified by keratin immunostaining). Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and. No. 4. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1B, No. 1C, No. 1D,. No. 2B, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C. HER2/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation. guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor. nodules (using tissue blocks B2 and B4).
