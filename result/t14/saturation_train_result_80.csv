HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe visualized utilizing. SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization). detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. ISHDIG. detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals (SISH). and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells.

The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified.

Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17.

The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%.

Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality. 5. No carcinoma identified. Note: This is an unusual tumor. H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested. Drs. and. have reviewed selected stides form this case and. concur with the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Working Draft. - Lobular carcinoma in situ: None. - Lymph node status: Negative. - Total number sampled: 2. - AJCC/UICC stage: pT1cNOMX. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies.
