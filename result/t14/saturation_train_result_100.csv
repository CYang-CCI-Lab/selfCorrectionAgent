GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ""left modified. radical mastectomy"" is a 1758 gram, 28.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a. linear 5. 0 x 0 x 1.0 cm Representative sections are sampled as labeled: 1. nipple trisected. 2. en face section of areola. 3. deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled. 4-7. sections of described solid tumor mass. 8. section of possible tumor extension abutting inked, inferior,. peripheral margin. 9. sections of upper outer quadrant biopsy cavity. 10. sections from upper outer quadrant. 11. lower outer quadrant sampled. 12. upper inner quadrant. 13. lower inner quadrant. 14-15. representative sections of two separate, large axillary lymph nodes. associated with upper outer quadrant. 16. whole lymph nodes. 17. whole lymph nodes.

A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom HerceptinÂ® therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..
