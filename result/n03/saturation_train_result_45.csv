METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

Additionally labeled left breast and contains a 641. gram, 20.0 x 13.5 x 7.0 cm simple mastectomy specimen. partially surfaced by a 17.5 x 9.3 cm ellipsé: of pink tan. wrinkled skin bearing a central 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm everted. nipple. No orientation is offered or possible. The deep. margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to. reveal a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm ill defined gray white gritty. mass that resides 3.5 cm from the skin surface and. approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep margin. Located immediately adjacent to this mass is a 3.5 x 2.8 x. 2.3 cm shaggy, necrotic cavity consistent with previous. biopsy site. This cavity resides 1.5 cm below the skin. surface and approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep. margin. The remainder of the cut surface is comprised of. predominantly yellow tan adipose tissue admixed with. moderate amounts of interspersed gray white fibrous tissue. No additional masses are identified. Also received in the same container is an 11.5 x 2.0 x 1.5. cm strip of pink tan wrinkled skin with adherent yellow tan. fibrofatty soft tissue.

INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS. Test. Description. Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report. Any negative Her2 IHC result. without optimal fixation time should have Her2 FISH testing. performed. FISH, HER2/neu refl to IHC: CYTOGENETIC RESULTSCylogenetic. Reference #: Test Setup Date: est.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

The breast has an overlying 24.0 x 12.5. cm portion of brown/black skin. The skin has a central to slightly eccentric 5.5 x 4.5 cm. areola. and a somewhat central 1.5 cm nipple. The skin surface has multiple papules with no. scars or lesions identified The deep margin is predominantly smooth and is inked blue. The. breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a central/lateral 2.0 x 1.0 x. 1. cm indurated to centrally necrotic hemorrhagic to yellow appearing tumor mass. The. tumor mass is at least 18 cm from medial, is approximately 5 cm from lateral. is. approximately 5 cm from superior and 5 cm from inferior. The tumor is 0.2 cm from the deep. margin and the deep margin slides easily over the mass. Sections of tumor are sampled for. Tissue Banking. A large, 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm, nodular lymph node is identified in the. lateral most aspect of the breast tissue. Two additional smaller lymph nodes are present. À. section of the large lymph node is sampled for frozen section diagnosis The two smaller. nodes are 0. and 0.8 cm. The remainder of the breast tissue is diffusely fibrous with. fibrocystic change There is indurated fibrocystic change adjacent to the tumor and ranges. up to an additional 2. 0 cm. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 75 and 80% of the. parenchyma. There is diffuse ecchymotic hemorrhage lateral to the tumor predominant in the. lower/outer quadrant. The breast tissue is diffusely nodular, however. no additional. discrete tumor like mass is identified Representative sections are sampled to be submitted. following overnight fixation for a repeat of tumor markers. The remainder of the specimen. will be held for fixation. Representative sections are sampled as labeled in the following. cassettes: A1. frozen section residue. A2. remainder of the lymph node.

C. Received fresh for Tissue Banking, labeled with the patient's name and ""right breast. with axillary node contents"" is a 445 gram. 23.0 x 13.0 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The. breast has an overlying 22.5 x 11.0 cm black/brown skin ellipse. The ellipse has multiple. raised papules across the surface and an eccentrically, medially located 6.0 x 5.0 cm. areola with a 1.3 cm mildly flattened nipple. No scars or lesions are identified on the. skin surface. The breast is received with a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm axillary tail and the. specimen is consistent with a modified radical mastectomy specimen. The deep fascial plane. is smooth and somewhat irregular. The deep fascial plane will be inked blue and the breast. is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a medially located 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.0. cm. tumor mass. The mass is 0.5 cm from the nearest inked deep margin. There is a portion. that comes within 0.6 cm of superior, 0.8 cm of medial and is 0.4 cm from inferior at the. medial most tip of the breast specimen A second spherical 2.0 cm mass is located in the. upper/outer quadrant This mass is 0. cm from the deep margin and the deep margin slides. easily over the mass. The second mass is approximately 2.5 cm from superior. is 12.5 cm. inferior, is 15 cm from medial and 8 cm from lateral. Further sectioning of the large mass. shows it to focally extend to the superior peripheral margin. The remainder of the breast. parenchyma has diffuse dense white fibrous tissue with diffuse fibrocystic change The. fibrous tissue makes up between 80 and 90% of the parenchyma. No additional discrete tumor. like masses are identified. The axillary tail is sectioned to have multiple nodular lymph. nodes. The nodes include tumor replaced nodes and range up to a positive. 4.8 x 2.5 x 2.5. cm, lymph node.
