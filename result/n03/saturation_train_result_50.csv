A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5. cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position The overlying superficial margin. adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked. with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges. are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized In the center. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. À. portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to. within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 O'clock. at its closest point. It is located well above the deep margin which is approximately 7 cm. beneath the mass. Cut sections through the remainder of the breast tissue reveals some. rubbery white parenchymal breast tissue and abundant yellow fat. There. are. other. nodules or mass is identified. Sections are submitted as follows: A1. nipple. A2-5 -. mass in breast. A6. mass in breast with adjacent tissue. A7-9 -. non-neoplastic appearing breast tissue. B. The. second specimen is received in the fresh state in the operating room and represents. two axillary lymph nodes, one measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.7 x. 0.7. cm. The cut sections are hard. A section of each is examined by frozen section. These are submitted in block B1, frozen section control. Additional section of each is. submitted in block B2. C. The. third specimen initially in the fresh state is labeled ""sentinel node #1"" and is a. piece of yellow fat measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm round moderately firm lymph node. which is bisected and submitted in toto in block C1. D. The fourth specimen is labeled ""level 3 axillary nodes"" The specimen is a piece of. yellow fatty tissue measuring 9 x 3 x 1.! cm with a suture marking the highest level 3. lymph node. There are five additional small lymph nodes. The highest node is submitted in. block D1 and the other five lymph nodes are submitted in block D2. E. The fifth container is labeled ""right axillary contents"" The specimen is yellow fatty. tissue measuring 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm. Within the fatty tissue are several nodules consistent. with. lymph nodes.

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum.

Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show. appropriate staining. The patient' S larger tumor was sampled and tested previously, which showed a similar. pattern of immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu. Subsequent in situ. hybridization studies for HER-2/neu gene amplification on that specimen showed that the. tumor was positive for Her-2/neu gene amplification. In situ hybridization studies can be. repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as. analyte specific reagents (ASR) or research use only (RUO) reagents. These were. developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not. been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA. has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests. are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational. or for research.

Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

Total CHR 17 signals;. 33. HER2/CHR 17 ratio: 1.3. INTERPRETATION: -/NEGATIVE FOR HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION. NOTE: THE ASSAY WAS PERFORMED AS A REFLEX TEST AFTER THE HER2/NEU. IMMUNOSTAIN WAS 2+. SPECIMEN TYPE: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. tissue slide from block B7. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe assay. enables the HER2 gene and Chrl7 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy. on the same slide. Specifically for this assay, HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe. visualized utilizing. SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is. targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. Red ISH DIG detection kit. Dual. ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals. (SISH) and Chrl7 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as. well as in carcinoma cells. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and. Chr17 copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within. 1.8-2.2 (EQUIVOCAL) the reader is recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is. calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gene status is reported as non-amplified (HER2/ Chr 17 < 2.0) or. amplified (HER2/Chrl7>2.0). The performance characteristics of this assay were determined by the. This assay has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug.

ER/PR/HER2 Results. ER: Pending. PR: Pending. HER2: Pending. Pathological staging (pTN): pT 2 N 3a. CLINICAL HISTORY: A -year-old Caucasian female post menopausal abnormal mammogram. Biopsy showed an. adenocarcinoma, ER/PR-, Her2+, 2 masses at right breast seen. One at 12 o'clock position subareolar,. 2nd mass at 1 o'clock posterior to 1st mass (3.0 cm). PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma. ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: B4. ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: B4. Interpretation: POSITIVE. Intensity: 3+. % Tumor Staining: 90%. Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology.

Since there are more than 10 positive lymph nodes, the 'New Rule 15: N3 stage indicates cancer metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, regardless of the presence of extranodal extension in the substaging' is also applicable. Therefore, the N stage is N3.",N3,38.0
