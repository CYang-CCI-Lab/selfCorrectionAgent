There is patchy. ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3. shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of. lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-lik areas and numerous foci of. ""Indian file"" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1. mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of. tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli. and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically. active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present. within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this. lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows. no evidence of malignancy.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

COMMENT: This report was amended to correct the number of positive nodes in the. microscopic section, in the ""Breast Carcinoma Checklist."" The Diagnosis. above is unchanged, and is correct, with a total of 2 positive nodes;. that count has been re-verified by review of the microscopic slides. The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate. that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The ""N"" stage has thus been. corrected to pN1, as well. This case was discussed with. it a recent. conference, and he in fact pointed out this discrepancy. I informed him. at that time that I would make these corrections to the report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ""left modified. radical mastectomy"" is a 1758 gram, 28.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes.
