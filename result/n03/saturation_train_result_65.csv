(medial to lateral) X 3.5 cm (anterior to posterior) breast lumpectomy specimen. on a radiographic grid with a corresponding x-ray film. There is a metallic. clip located in the center of a spiculated irregularly shaped mass which. corresponds to C3-C4, D3-D4 and D5. The metallic clip is located in D4. There. is a questionable extension of the mass into grids E3-E4. A wire extends through. the center of this mass entering at B5 and terminating at F1. The specimen is. received with two sutures, long designating lateral and short designating. superior. The margins are inked as follows: superior blue, inferior green,. anterior black, posterior red, lateral violet and medial yellow.

There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom HerceptinÂ® therapy is being considered.

The breast has an. overlying 22.0 x 8.5 cm portion of tan-white skin. The skin has a central 6.5 x 5.5 cm. areola and 1.5 cm raised nipple. There is a green suture on the skin designating 12. o'clock. An indurated nodule is present beneath the skin surface directly medial to the. nipple and underlying the areola. The skin surface and areola have multiple plaque-like. pigmented papules. The largest papule is superior and lateral at the edge of the areola. This papule is 1.6 x 0.8 cm. No additional scars or lesions are identified on the skin. surface The deep margin is ragged and fatty. The specimen is consistent with a simple. mastectomy specimen. The deep margin is inked blue, and the breast is sectioned to have a diffusely glistening. fatty. cut surface. Ã€ medial, 2.3 cm nodular tumor mass is present beneath the skin surface. medial in the described area beneath the areola. The tumor has a focal multinodular. appearance at the periphery. but appears to be one mass grossly The mass is 0.7 cm from. the. skin surface, is 6.0 cm from superior, is 3.0 cm from inferior. is 5.0 cm from medial. and 18. 5 cm from lateral. The tumor is at least 4.5 cm from the deep margin. The tumor. has a central stellate, gritty indurated cut surface, and further sectioning shows the. tumor to range up to 2.8 cm. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking The. remainder of the parenchyma is diffusely fatty with scant, delicate white fibrous tissue. No additional tumor-like masses are identified.
