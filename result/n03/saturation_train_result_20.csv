MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. This modified radial mastectomy specimen contains two. foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The larger is in the. mid-medial portion measuring 3.8 cm. The smaller one is in the. lower outer quadrant, 6.5 cm lateral to the larger tumor. Morphologically, they are quite similar and both of high grade. Between the tumors, lymphovascular space invasion is present without. parenchymal invasion. The smaller tumor is also associated with. high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. It is likely, therefore, that. these two foci represent separate primaries, even though there. remains a possibility that the smaller tumor is metastatic. Please. see the template below. The template incorporates the findings on. both of the tumors. Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Both tumors are poorly differentiated. Overall grade: Elston SBR grade 3. Architectural score: 3. Nuclear score: 3. Mitotic score: 3. Greatest dimension (pT) : The larger tumor measures 3.8 cm and. the smaller. measures 2 cm, pT2. Specimen margins: : Negative. Vessel invasion: Extensive lymphatic invasion present. Calcification: Negative. Nipple (Paget's) : Negative for Pagets's. Dermal lymphatic. invasion present. Invasion of skin or chest wall: Negative. Ductal carcinoma in situ: Both tumors are associated with similar. high-grade. ductal carcinoma in situ. Histologic pattern: Cribriform and solid. Nuclear grade: 3. Central necrosis: Positive. 8 DCIS of total tumor (if mixed) : DCIS is a minor component. Extensive intraductal component (present/absent) : Absent. Specimen margins: Negative. Calcification: Positive. Description of non-tumorous breast: Fibrocystic changes present. including. cysts and apocrine metaplasia. Random sections of the lower. inner. quadrant and lower outer quadrant disclose lymphatic. invasion. Comments: In the mid-breast, a biopsy site is noted consistent with. prior core biopsy. This site discloses lymphovascular space. invasion. Lymph nodes: Number of positive nodes of total: Eight out of 10 lymph contain. metastatic carcinoma, including the apical node, 8/10. Size of largest metastasis: 1.0 cm. Extracapsular extension (present/absent) : Absent. pN: pN2a. Distant metastasis (pM) : Cannot be assessed. Prognostic markers: Previously performed. B. This simple mastectomy specimen contains a large biopsy. cavity. In the vicinity there is lobular carcinoma in. situ. No invasive tumor and no ductal carcinoma in situ present.

856,TCGA-AR-A1AM.10C43124-3C21-443C-8268-23BF8A4D317E,2,"; Final Diagnosis. Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Multiple (2) nodules of invasive mammary carcinoma are. identified. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 1/3,. mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9] is identified forming a mass (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm) located in. the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC pTlc]. This cancer shows HER2/neu protein. overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel. lymph node No. 1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible. by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision. below). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;. Nottingham score /9] is identified forming a second lesion (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) in the upper outer. quadrant located 0.6 cm inferior and medial to the first lobular carcinoma mass [AJCC pT1c]. This tumor also shows HER2/neu protein overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below). However, there is no morphologic evidence of metastasis by this second lesion into any of the. sentinel lymph nodes. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present within and outside the. invasive component with a separate nodule in the central/deep breast, 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, located. 1.4 cm medial to the infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Angiolymphatic invasion is not seen. The. non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes. are present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All. surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor. free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior/superior margin). Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 12) right axillary sentinel lymph. node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1 mi (sn)]. This positive sentinel node is. designated No. 1D (tissue block A4) and is characterized by a roughly 1.1 mm collection of. keratin positive tumor cells without much in the way of H&E morphologic correlation. As noted. above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary. sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (verified by keratin immunostaining). Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and. No. 4. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1B, No. 1C, No. 1D,. No. 2B, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C. HER2/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation. guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor. nodules (using tissue blocks B2 and B4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for. HER2/neu amplification will be performed and reported in an addendum. HER2 protein immunohistochemical (IHC) test results are only valid for non-decalcified paraffin. embedded specimens fixed in neutral buffered formalin or Bouin's fixatives. Testing is. performed using commercially available kit/reagents employing a polyclonal antibody and a. polymer-based detection system. ADDENDA: No amplification for HER2/neu is demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH,. performed in Laboratory Genetics) (blocks B2 and B4) according to the interpretation guidelines. in the FDA approved PathVysion Her2 DNA Probe Kit.",BRCA,1,The pathology report specifies that there is metastasis to a single sentinel lymph node (right axillary sentinel lymph node No. 1D) out of 12 examined lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N1 stage according to the AJCC staging system for breast cancer.,N1,13.0
