INTERPRETATION. nuc ish(D17Z1,ERBB2)x2-6[80]. No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu. / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FISH test was developed and Its performance determined by the. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, this laboratory has established and vermed the test's. accuracy and precision.

The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calculate the H-score is also shown above in. the report. Generally, the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According to. the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H-score of 251 (>75% cells staining); H-. score of 130 (51-75% cells staining); H-score of 42 (10-50% cells staining); H-score of 4 (<10% cells staining).
