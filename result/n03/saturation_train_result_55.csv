GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast and axilla"", fresh. Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1.

In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."".

Received is a right mastectomy. specimen with a 15 x 8.5 cm ellipse of tan skin. The nipple and areola are. located relatively centrally and somewhat inferiorly; there is no nipple. retraction. There is a healing peri-areolar incision site running from. approximately the 10:00 to 1:00 position in the upper outer and portion of. upper inner quadrant which measures 4.5 cm in length. There is an elevated. brown skin nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm located at the lateral tip of. the skin ellipse, which is grossly consistent with a seborrheic keratosis. other skin lesions are identified. The underlying breast tissue measures 20 x 11 x 3 cm. Sectioning through the. breast parenchyma after margins are inked reveals dense fibrous parenchyma. In. the upper breast, at the junction of upper inner and upper outer quadrant,. there is a healing biopsy cavity which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm; this is. surrounded by fat necrosis and firm tissue and has a hemorrhagic rim with no. definite gross residual tumor. The biopsy changes extend to within 2.5 cm of. the deep margin. No masses or other abnormalities are identified. Block Summary: B1- sections of seborrheic keratosis. B2- nipple and areola, and skin with healing biopsy scar. B3- B5- sections of wall of biopsy cavity. B6- margins to deep to biopsy site (tangential). B7- random sections, upper outer quadrant. B8- random sections, upper inner quadrant. B9- random sections, lower inner quadrant. B10-random sections, lower outer quadrant. There is no definite axillary tail attached to the specimen. There is a strip. of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm, in which no lymph nodes are. grossly identified. Sections of fibrofatty axillary tissue are submitted in. Blocks B11 and B12. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.

The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section. diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. Part C, labeled. consists of a single soft,. irregular piece of red-yellow, fatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm. Fatty tissue is trimmed away,. and a single candidate lymph node is found. The candidate fymph node is entirely submitted for. frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted in cassette C1. The remaining unused fatty. tissue is entirely submitted in cassette C2. Part D, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette D1. Part E, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette E1. Part F is received in formalin and additionally labeled. It consists of a 9-gm. breast lumpectomy specimen, measuring 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 5 cm from superior to. inferior, and 3.5 cm from lateral to medial. There is a short stitch designated as superior and a long. stitch designated as lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior superior blue, anterior inferior. green, and posterior black. Prior to receipt by me (Dr. the posterior portion of the. breast has been incised and tissue removed for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned,. from medial to lateral, into eight slices and reveals a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule (1.5 x 1 x. 0.9 cm) in slices 3 through 6. The tumor nodule is located approximately 1 cm from both the lateral-. and medial-most margins, 0.7 cm from the superior margin, and 1.3 cm from the inferior margin. The. closest approach to a margin is in slice 6, where it appears to abut the anterior-mid portion of the. specimen (<1 mm grossly from the blue/green-inked margin). The specimen is entirely submitted as. follows: Cassette F1: Medial-most margin. Cassette F2: Slice 2, superior. Cassette F3: Slice 2, inferior. Cassette F4: Slice 3, superior (and nodule).

Date Complete: Addendum Comment. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block F6. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in ~50% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is weak to moderate nuclear staining in ~15%. of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block F6 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.
