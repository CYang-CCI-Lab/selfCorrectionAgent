The metastatic tumor in Part A was only present in the additionally submitted. sections of the lymph node (slide A2). Level sections on A2-A4 confirms the diagnosis. Select slides from. part C were shown at the. the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed A2. and concurs with the diagnosis. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C9. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification.

A positive Estrogen or Progesterane receptor tumor shows. nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to 1% of the tumor cells (i.e. and H-score of 1 or higher). The ER and PR.

The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calculate the H-score is also shown above in. the report. Generally, the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According to. the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H-score of 251 (>75% cells staining); H-. score of 130 (51-75% cells staining); H-score of 42 (10-50% cells staining); H-score of 4 (<10% cells staining).

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom HerceptinÂ® therapv is being considered.

Glandular tissue showing adenosis sclerosans et calcifications. Histopathological diagnosis: (including Examination. Carcinoma lobulare invasivum mammae dextrae. Invasive lobular carcinoma of the right breast). (NHG2, pT2, pNo/sn/).",BRCA,0,"The report mentions that the tumor size is 3.2 x 1.8 x 2.8 cm, which classifies it as pT2. The N stage is determined by the presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, but the report states 'pNo/sn/', indicating no regional lymph node metastasis, so the N stage is N0. The M stage is not specified in the report, so it is assumed to be M0 (no distant metastasis).",pT2 pN0,16.0
