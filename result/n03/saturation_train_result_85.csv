INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: E - right breast wide local excision needle localization: Tumor is 1.7 cm located 1.3 cm from the nearest/lateral. margin called by Dr to Dr. at. ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above. reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen. and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTes. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a. linear 5. 0 x 0 x 1.0 cm Representative sections are sampled as labeled: 1. nipple trisected. 2. en face section of areola. 3. deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled. 4-7. sections of described solid tumor mass. 8. section of possible tumor extension abutting inked, inferior,. peripheral margin. 9. sections of upper outer quadrant biopsy cavity. 10. sections from upper outer quadrant. 11. lower outer quadrant sampled. 12. upper inner quadrant. 13. lower inner quadrant. 14-15. representative sections of two separate, large axillary lymph nodes. associated with upper outer quadrant. 16. whole lymph nodes. 17. whole lymph nodes.

Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS (ER/PR) TEST DETAILS: Using formalin fixed tissues (8-96 hours) and appropriate. positive and negative internal/external controls; the test for the presence of hormone receptor protein is performed by the. immunoperoxidase method according to the ASCO-CAP Guidelines. A positive Estrogen or Progesterane receptor tumor shows. nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to 1% of the tumor cells (i.e. and H-score of 1 or higher). The ER and PR. Histologic Score (H-Score, or HS) is calculated as the sum of intensity of staining times the proportion of cells staining and has a. dynamic range of 0 to 300. The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calculate the H-score is also shown above in. the report. Generally, the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According to. the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H-score of 251 (>75% cells staining); H-. score of 130 (51-75% cells staining); H-score of 42 (10-50% cells staining); H-score of 4 (<10% cells staining).

See comment. - Largest tumor nodule: 1.5 cm in diameter (6 o'clock aspect). - Two smaller nodules: 0.6 and 0.8 cm (7-8 o'clock aspect). - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high nuclear grade, solid type. - DCIS comprises less than 10% of biopsy tissue volume, and is associated. with all three invasive tumor nodules. - Mastectomy margins are free of tumor. - Carcinoma is 3 cm from the inferior margin and is at least 6 cm from. all other margins. Metastatic carcinoma in three of fifteen lymph nodes (3/15). - Largest metastatic focus: 0.9 cm in diameter. - Extranodal extension present. - Positive lymph nodes are sentinel lymph nodes #2, #3, and #4. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2-3. Type and grade (in situ): DCIS, high-nuclear grade. Primary tumor: pT1c(m). Regional lymph nodes: pN1c. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Stage: IIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Indeterminate. Margin status: Negative. COMMENT: The three foci of invasive carcinoma have similar histologic features,. although the tumor grade is somewhat variable in the largest tumor nodule, where. there is a variable rate of mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism ranging from. intermediate to high-grade. The smaller tumor nodules contain high-grade malignant. Printed: This report continues. Acct No. -. Pathology - Page 1/6. Page 1 Doc# 1.
