The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable.
