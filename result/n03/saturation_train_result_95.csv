Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This is. located more centrally but in the lower outer quadrant. The larger firm mass. surrounding the biopsy cavity to within approximately 0.5 cm of the surgical. margin but the fibroadipose tissue on the deep surface is easily clear over. the lesions.

There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

Fish Ordered: Yes on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5. cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position The overlying superficial margin. adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked. with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges. are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized In the center. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. À. portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to. within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 O'clock. at its closest point. It is located well above the deep margin which is approximately 7 cm. beneath the mass.

WLE LEFT BREAST. - Received fresh and labeled, Wide Local Excision, Left Breast with Needle Localization"" is an oval. shaped piece of yellow-tan fibrofatty soft tissue weighing 161 grams and measuring 9.2x8.1x3.2cm. The specimen is received with an accompanying radiogram which shows a needle coursing from the. medial aspect to the lateral aspect. The needle is a stellate area of increased density and a surgical. clip is present. The specimen has been oriented in surgery with short designating superior long lateral. and looped anterior. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red, lateral-yellow,. anterior-blue, medial-green and posterior black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior. and in the inferior aspect of the specimen is an irregularly shaped firm pink-tan mass measuring. 3.7x3.5x1.5cm. Areas of hemorrhage are seen. The mass is within 1. 1cm from the lateral margin,. 1.2cm from the anterior margin, 2.2cm from the medial margin, 1.7cm from the deep margin, 1.7cm. from the inferior margin and approximately 4.4cm from the superior margin. Superior and slightly. posterior from this mass is a firm tan nodule measuring 0.7cm which is located 0.8cm from the larger. mass. It is possible that it is a continuous mass located 1.2cm from the lateral margin, 3.7cm from the. anterior margin, 1.3cm from the posterior margin and 4.8cm from the medial margin. This mass. corresponds with the increased area of density and second needle localization which is present on the. radiogram which is shown superior to the larger mass. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: H1-H6 larger mass including adjacent margins; H7-H8 breast tissue between larger mass and. smaller mass; H9 smaller mass; H10-H13 additional fibrous breast tissue; H14 superior margin; H15. inferior margin. I. ADDITIONAL MARGIN LEFT BREAST: - Received in formalin and labeled Additional Margin Left Breast. This Marks New Inferior Margin"" is. an irregularly shaped piece of yellow-tan fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 4.7x4.7x0.8cm. There is a. stitch present marking the new inferior margin. The margin is inked blue and serially sectioned. On. sectioning little fibrous tissue is seen and no masses or lesions are found. Specimen is submitted in. toto in blocks I1-I10. COMMENT: Review of the original touch prep, for sentinel lymph node #2, shows a single minute focus of metastatic. tumor cells. The metastatic deposit in sentinel lymph node #2 measures 4mm in greatest diameter, and. shows approximately 1mm of extracapsular extension focally. Gross examination of the left breast wide. local excision shows an irregularly shaped 3.7x3.5x1.5cm lesion, which is grossly away from the. margins of excision. On gross examination, there is a separate firm nodule which measures 0.7cm in. diameter which is near the larger tumor mass. Examination of microscopic sections, in the intervening. breast between these two nodules, however shows continuity of the 2nd smaller nodule with the larger. mass, consistent with an irregular, dumbbell shaped single lesion. This patient had ER, PR and HER2. IHC performed on her prior needle core biopsy . These results were ER positive, PR positive and. HER2 was found to be amplified by FISH. Specimens Involved.
