It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 381 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this. orientation, the specimen measures 16 cm from medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 4. cm from anterior to posterior. There is an overlying ellipse of tan skin measuring 11.8 x 7 cm. The areola. measures 3.3 cm and the nipple appears slightly inverted. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin. which consists variably of smooth facial. appearing tissue and lobulated fatty tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned along the. superior-inferior axis resulting in fifteen slabs. Slab #1 is most medial. In the central portion of the excision, in slabs 6-9, there is a stellate hard, gritty neoplasm (tumor #1) which. overall measures 4 cm from medial to lateral, 1.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 1 cm from anterior to. posterior. This neoplasm is 1.5 cm from the closest skin. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin. and is greater than 4 cm from all other margins. Representative sections of the medial portion of the tissue. are obtained for research purposes and the biopsy site clip is identified within the neoplasm in slab 7. Slab 10 (intervening tissue between tumor #1 and tumors #2 and #3) consists of palpably unremarkable. fibrofatty tissue. In slab 11, 1 cm lateral to the tumor #1, there is chalky yellow discoloration and slight retraction of the. fibrofatty tissue suggestive of two small deposits of neoplastic tissue. The larger of these (tumor #2) is 8 cm. lateral to the nipple. It measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.6 cm and is greater than 2 cm from the anterior-superior,. anterior-inferior, and posterior margins. It is 2.3 cm from the closest lateral margin and widely free of the. medial margin. The smaller tumor deposit (tumor #3) measures 0,5 cm and is 0.8 cm superior of the larger deposit in slab. 11. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin and greater than 2 cm from all other margins. No. other palpable lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the. excision. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: B1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple,.

There is an overlying broad ellipse of tan skin which measures 12 x 7 cm. In the lateral skin, there is a 0.4 cm violaceous skin lesion. Centrally, there is a well-delineated 4 cm. areola and a flat to slightly retracted appearing 1 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue,. the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of lobulated fatty. tissue, with central fascial appearing tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close. intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white fibrous parenchyma which is most. prominent centrally. The fibrous parenchyma is focally finely nodular to palpation but there are no. discrete areas suggestive of invasive neoplasm. There are scattered small fluid-filled cysts within the. fibrous parenchyma. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted.

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum.

In situ hybridization studies can be. repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired.
