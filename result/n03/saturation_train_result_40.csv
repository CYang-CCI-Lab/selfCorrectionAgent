HER-2NEU: SCORE 1+, negative. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block A4) using the. following monocional antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1E2) and. Her-2neu (. Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score. 1+. T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies,. reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively. stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on. webpage): Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong. HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist. 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a. portion of the membrane is positive.. Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the. membrane is positive. Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in > 10% of tumor cells or. circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells. Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform. membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dako. blowing the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate,. well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology.

COMMENT: This report was amended to correct the number of positive nodes in the. microscopic section, in the ""Breast Carcinoma Checklist."" The Diagnosis. above is unchanged, and is correct, with a total of 2 positive nodes;. that count has been re-verified by review of the microscopic slides. The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate. that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The ""N"" stage has thus been. corrected to pN1, as well. This case was discussed with. it a recent. conference, and he in fact pointed out this discrepancy. I informed him. at that time that I would make these corrections to the report.
