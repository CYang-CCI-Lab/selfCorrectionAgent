The breast has an. overlying 22.0 x 8.5 cm portion of tan-white skin. The skin has a central 6.5 x 5.5 cm. areola and 1.5 cm raised nipple. There is a green suture on the skin designating 12. o'clock. An indurated nodule is present beneath the skin surface directly medial to the. nipple and underlying the areola. The skin surface and areola have multiple plaque-like. pigmented papules. The largest papule is superior and lateral at the edge of the areola. This papule is 1.6 x 0.8 cm. No additional scars or lesions are identified on the skin. surface The deep margin is ragged and fatty. The specimen is consistent with a simple. mastectomy specimen. The deep margin is inked blue, and the breast is sectioned to have a diffusely glistening. fatty. cut surface. Ã€ medial, 2.3 cm nodular tumor mass is present beneath the skin surface. medial in the described area beneath the areola. The tumor has a focal multinodular. appearance at the periphery. but appears to be one mass grossly The mass is 0.7 cm from. the. skin surface, is 6.0 cm from superior, is 3.0 cm from inferior. is 5.0 cm from medial. and 18. 5 cm from lateral. The tumor is at least 4.5 cm from the deep margin. The tumor. has a central stellate, gritty indurated cut surface, and further sectioning shows the. tumor to range up to 2.8 cm. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking The. remainder of the parenchyma is diffusely fatty with scant, delicate white fibrous tissue. No additional tumor-like masses are identified.

B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the -. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu. /CEP17. Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

In. making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical. information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of. involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.

HOT SPOT #1, AXILLA I, CT-xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic. carcinoma (block B): Keratin: NEGATIVE (see note). Note: A single cell that appears to be keratin positive is present in the subcapsular space. However, the nuclear size. and morphology of this cell is different than the primary tumor cells. Selected slides were reviewed with Dr. XX and. concurs with the diagnosis. C. HOT SPOT #1, AXILLAI CT -xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic. carcinoma (C): Keratin: NEGATIVE. Interpretation Guidelines: For hormone receptor immunohistochemical analysis, the percent of immunoreactive. nuclei in the invasive or in-situ carcinoma is assessed manually by light microscopic examination and reported as. follows: Positive: greater than or equal to 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive. Negative: less than 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive. Non-neoplastic mammary epithelial cells are immunoreactive for estrogen and progesterone receptors (internal. control). For HER2/neu immunohistochemical analysis, the cell membrane staining is assessed manually by light microscopic. examination. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity alone is scored as a negative result.

The first specimen submitted in the fresh state is labeled ""right breast tissue"" The. specimen is the right breast, total mastectomy specimen Suture marks the axillary tail of. the breast. There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5. cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position The overlying superficial margin. adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked. with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges. are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized In the center. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. Ã€. portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to. within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 O'clock. at its closest point. It is located well above the deep margin which is approximately 7 cm. beneath the mass. Cut sections through the remainder of the breast tissue reveals some. rubbery white parenchymal breast tissue and abundant yellow fat. There. are. other. nodules or mass is identified. Sections are submitted as follows: A1. nipple. A2-5 -. mass in breast. A6. mass in breast with adjacent tissue. A7-9 -. non-neoplastic appearing breast tissue. B. The. second specimen is received in the fresh state in the operating room and represents. two axillary lymph nodes, one measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.7 x. 0.7. cm. The cut sections are hard. A section of each is examined by frozen section. These are submitted in block B1, frozen section control. Additional section of each is. submitted in block B2. C. The. third specimen initially in the fresh state is labeled ""sentinel node #1"" and is a. piece of yellow fat measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm round moderately firm lymph node. which is bisected and submitted in toto in block C1. D. The fourth specimen is labeled ""level 3 axillary nodes"" The specimen is a piece of. yellow fatty tissue measuring 9 x 3 x 1.! cm with a suture marking the highest level 3. lymph node. There are five additional small lymph nodes. The highest node is submitted in. block D1 and the other five lymph nodes are submitted in block D2. E. The fifth container is labeled ""right axillary contents"" The specimen is yellow fatty. tissue measuring 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm. Within the fatty tissue are several nodules consistent. with. lymph nodes. The largest of these measures 2 cm in diameter and on cut section is. partially replaced by very hard white tissue. A section of each node is. submitted. in. blocks E1 through E4.
