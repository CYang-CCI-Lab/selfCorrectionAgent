Select slides from. part C were shown at the. the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed A2. and concurs with the diagnosis. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C9. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. This modified radial mastectomy specimen contains two. foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The larger is in the. mid-medial portion measuring 3.8 cm. The smaller one is in the. lower outer quadrant, 6.5 cm lateral to the larger tumor. Morphologically, they are quite similar and both of high grade. Between the tumors, lymphovascular space invasion is present without. parenchymal invasion. The smaller tumor is also associated with. high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. It is likely, therefore, that. these two foci represent separate primaries, even though there. remains a possibility that the smaller tumor is metastatic. Please. see the template below. The template incorporates the findings on. both of the tumors. Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Both tumors are poorly differentiated. Overall grade: Elston SBR grade 3. Architectural score: 3. Nuclear score: 3. Mitotic score: 3. Greatest dimension (pT) : The larger tumor measures 3.8 cm and. the smaller. measures 2 cm, pT2. Specimen margins: : Negative. Vessel invasion: Extensive lymphatic invasion present. Calcification: Negative. Nipple (Paget's) : Negative for Pagets's. Dermal lymphatic. invasion present. Invasion of skin or chest wall: Negative. Ductal carcinoma in situ: Both tumors are associated with similar. high-grade. ductal carcinoma in situ. Histologic pattern: Cribriform and solid.

Calcification: Positive. Description of non-tumorous breast: Fibrocystic changes present. including. cysts and apocrine metaplasia. Random sections of the lower. inner. quadrant and lower outer quadrant disclose lymphatic. invasion. Comments: In the mid-breast, a biopsy site is noted consistent with. prior core biopsy. This site discloses lymphovascular space. invasion. Lymph nodes: Number of positive nodes of total: Eight out of 10 lymph contain. metastatic carcinoma, including the apical node, 8/10. Size of largest metastasis: 1.0 cm. Extracapsular extension (present/absent) : Absent. pN: pN2a. Distant metastasis (pM) : Cannot be assessed. Prognostic markers: Previously performed. B. This simple mastectomy specimen contains a large biopsy. cavity. In the vicinity there is lobular carcinoma in. situ. No invasive tumor and no ductal carcinoma in situ present. An E-cadherin stain was performed on block #1. Fibrocystic changes. are noted, including cysts, apocrine metaplasia, florid ductal. hyperplasia and calcifications. The nipple is negative for tumor,. as is the overlying skin. [A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as. analyte. specific reagents.

The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.
