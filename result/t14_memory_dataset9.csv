COMMENT: This report was amended to correct the number of positive nodes in the. microscopic section, in the ""Breast Carcinoma Checklist."" The Diagnosis. above is unchanged, and is correct, with a total of 2 positive nodes;. that count has been re-verified by review of the microscopic slides. The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate. that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The ""N"" stage has thus been. corrected to pN1, as well. This case was discussed with. it a recent. conference, and he in fact pointed out this discrepancy. I informed him. at that time that I would make these corrections to the report. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a. year-old woman with biopsy proven infiltrating. lobular cancer of the left breast (ER+ PR+ Her2/neu-). Operative. procedure: Sentinel lymph node biopsies, left modified radical. mastectomy and right simple mastectomy. GROSS: Received are four fresh containers each labeled with the patient's name. A. The first container is additionally labeled ""A - left. sentinel lymph node #1."" The specimen consists of a 2.1 X 2.06 cm. fragment of pale, yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. A single potential. lymph node is identified measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The. node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section. analysis as AFS1. B. The next container is labeled ""B - left sentinel lymph node. #2."" The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm fragment of. yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. Two potential lymph nodes are identified. measuring 0.8 X 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The smaller node is inked. black. The nodes are serially sectioned and entirely submitted for. frozen section analysis as BFS1. The remaining adipose tissue is. submitted for permanent sections in cassette B2. Summary of Sections: BFS1 - two potential sentinel lymph nodes, entirely submitted. B2 - remaining soft tissue. C. The next container is labeled ""C - left breast at 12 o'clock. with left axillary node dissection."" The specimen consists of a 613 gm. modified radical mastectomy with axillary tail. The breast measures 17. cm medial to lateral, 15.5 cm superior to inferior and 3.9 cm. superficial to deep. The attached axillary tail measures 8 X 7.5 x 2. cm. There is an attached ovoid portion of skin measuring 4 X 3.5 cm. with an everted, freely mobile nipple which measures 2.5 X 2.5 cm with. the areolar complex. The deep fascial plane is inked black, the. remaining superior half is inked blue with the remaining inferior half. inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. A gray-white, firm, irregularly-bordered mass is identified in the. upper outer quadrant measuring 3.2 X 2.2 X 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. This mass is consistent with a bilobed single mass. However, it could. represent two separate masses. The central area of the mass is. submitted which could represent normal parenchyma in between the two. masses. The mass is 1.8 cm to the deep margin and 2.5 cm to the nipple. A dumbbell-shaped biopsy clip is identified near the medial portion of. the mass. There are firm, indurated possibly calcified areas located. posteriorly to the nipple. The axillary tail is dissected to reveal 19. potential lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.6 cm in greatest. dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted. The specimen is sectioned. and laced in formalin. Summary of Sections: C1 - middle portion of mass. C2-C3 - medical portion of tumor. C4 - lateral portion of tumor with deep margin.

Received fresh is a tan-pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). Dissection reveals a firm presumptive. lymph node (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Submitted in toto in. A1. B. LEFT BREAST. Received fresh labeled ""left breast"" is a 1,184-gram simple mastectomy specimen (27.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm) with. a. stitch on the axillary tail. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin (15.0 x 10.5 cm) with a 1. cm centrally located, partially flattened nipple and 3.5 cm areola rim. The skin surface is remarkable for a grey-white,. well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1 cm that is 8.0 cm from the nipple. The specimen is inked. and serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 14 being most lateral. The. nipple is located in slice 8. The cut surface reveals a grey-white, firm, stellate mass (6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm) located in. the upper central and upper outer quadrants and present in slices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This mass measures 1.5 cm. from all margins. A second lesion is located in the 7 o'clock position (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in slice 6. Lesion #2 is. located 0.6 cm from lesion #1, and measures 1.5 cm from the closest inferior margin. An ill-defined nodular area. (lesion 3) is located 4.5 cm superior to lesion #2 in slice 6 and more than 2.0 cm from the deep margin. A portion of. the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Gross examination did not reveal distinct 12:00 and 10:00 lesions. as designated on the request form. Lesions 2 and 3 may correspond to the 10:00 lesions as they did appear grossly. separate from the main tumor mass, although very close. The main mass appeared confluent grossly and may. encompass the 12:00 lesion. The remaining cut surfaces reveal predominantly yellow lobulated adipose. tissue. interspersed with grey-white fibrous tissue.

A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for. (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None given. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed mild polysomy 17 with 2. to 3 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 5 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. B20. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. /, under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Pagetoid spread of carcinoma is seen in benign ducts adjacent to the tumor. No such spread is seen away. from the tumor. Atypical lobular hyperplasia is present in the contralateral (right) breast. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block C3. The test for estrogen receptors is positve. There is moderate nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: A17 (smaller tumor). Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 40%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therans insidered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. Microscopic/Diagnostic DictationPathologist,.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results.

Block used. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No:NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.1. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable.

No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions.

Sections from. specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular. carcinoma, focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size is. difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evident. tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by. carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to bé accurate as. a. true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node. sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/BPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma. morphologically identical to the mammary primary.

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU, SOLID TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 3 WITH COMEDO-TYPE NECROSIS,. COMPRISING LESS THAN 5% OF TUMOR. D. SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA AND DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-. SITU. E. INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA FOCALLY APPROACHES VERY CLOSELY MARGIN OF EXCISION IN. THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT (WITHIN 0.2 CM). F. NIPPLE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. G. CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS CORE BIOPSY SITE. H. TWO LYMPH NODES, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (2 OUT OF 2). PART 2: LEFT BREAST, NEW ANTERIOR-INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION -. SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. PART 3: LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BIOPSY -. ONE LYMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1 OUT OF 1). PART 4: LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, BIOPSY -. ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0 OUT OF 1). PART 5: LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, BIOPSY -. ONE LYMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1 OUT OF 1). PART 6: LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, EXCISION -. FIVE OF ELEVEN LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA, THREE WITH EXTRACAPSULAR. EXTENSION. PART 7: RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, EXCISION (396 GRAMS) -. A.
