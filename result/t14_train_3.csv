Specimen B is received in the fresh state labeled ""right modified radical mastectomy"". This is a breast with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin ellipse. measures 20 x. 15 cm. The breast measures 20 x 15 x 4 cm. The axillary tail measures 8 x 8. x. 3. cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The chest all margin is fatty without focal. lesions. The chest wall margin is inked black. There is some palpable nodularity along. the medial most margin and this margin is inked blue, Serial sections through the breast. reveal mostly fatty tissue with irregular areas of white fibrosis. In the central breast. roughly 3 cm inferior to the nipple is an ill-defined, indurated area suspicious for tumor. and associated with fresh hemorrhage. This area spans approximately 1 cm by palpation and. a portion of this area is submitted for tumor banking, handed off to. There. appears. to. be. a. separate tumorous area in the lateral breast roughly 6 cm from the nipple. and spanning by palpation roughly 3 cm. Again, this area is visually ill-defined. There. may be yet a third .11-defined indurated area in the far lateral breast spanning. approximately 7 mm. Several fatty lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail. These. measure up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: B1,2 -. nodularity in the medial most breast. B3. nipple.

Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality. 5. No carcinoma identified. Note: This is an unusual tumor. H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested. Drs. and. have reviewed selected stides form this case and. concur with the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Total points and overall grade = 4 points = grade 1. - Lymphatic-vascular Invasion: None. - Skin/nipple: No specific pathologic abnormalities. - Margins for invasive tumor: Negative. - Anterior (skin): N/A. - Posterior: Negative (tumor is > 1 cm away). - Inferior lateral margin (black ink): Negative; (tumor is >1 cm away, on stide C4). - Inferior medial margin (green Ink): Negative; (tumor is > 1 cm away, on slide C5). - Superior margin (blue Ink): Negative; (tumor is >1 cm away, on slide C3). - Microcalcifications: Present, involving benign ducts. Working Draft. - Lobular carcinoma in situ: None. - Lymph node status: Negative. - Total number sampled: 2. - AJCC/UICC stage: pT1cNOMX. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies. Together, these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of benign quiescent nodes, and argue against. a diagnosis of lymphoma. Dr. of.

Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, 10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..

Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from.

GROSS INSPECTION: New medial margin. Negative for tumor. Diagnosis called to Dr. at. 1 by. Dr. ADDENDUM: FISH for HER-2 amplification for this case was attempted multiple times using multiple blocks from this. case. In each instance the tissue would not remain on the slide for analysis. As a result of this one block. will be sent to another laboratory for further testing. This case was sent to the for second opinion for HER-2 FISH. The results reported below are the. verbatim results of this referral. HER2 Amp. Breast Cancer. FISH. Specimen. Tissue-Paraffin. Specimen ID. Source. Left breast. Reason For Referral. r/o HER2 gene amplification. Fixative. Formalin. Method: FISH using probes for HER2 (17q12) and a chromosome 17 centromere (D17Z1) control probe. (PathVysion,. Two technologists score signals in 60 total nuclei from invasive or. metastatic tumor and concurrent controls. nuc ish (D17Z1x2, Her2x3-5). The HER2 to D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. Interpretation: The invasive tumor nuclei have an amplified HER2D17Z1 ratio (per ASCO/CAP. The HER2D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. In our opinion, this result may not. guidelines). reflect centromere true HER2 and amplification. 3-5 copies of Most the HER2 nuclei gene. have 2 This copies result of the indicates chromosome the. 17 tumor has. additional copies of the HER2 gene (i.e., duplication), but does not have sufficient. copies to suggest high level HER2 amplification. It is not known if HER2. duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Arch Path Lab Med 131:18-43, 2007). A HER2D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene amplification. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined. by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, It is intended as. an adjunct to existing prognostic clinical and pathologic information for breast cancer. patients.

SPECIMEN TYPE: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. tissue slide from block B7. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The. HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe assay. enables the HER2 gene and Chrl7 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy. on the same slide. Specifically for this assay, HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe. visualized utilizing. SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is. targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. Red ISH DIG detection kit. Dual. ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals. (SISH) and Chrl7 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as. well as in carcinoma cells. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and. Chr17 copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within. 1.8-2.2 (EQUIVOCAL) the reader is recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is. calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gene status is reported as non-amplified (HER2/ Chr 17 < 2.0) or. amplified (HER2/Chrl7>2.0). The performance characteristics of this assay were determined by the.

Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochernical stainings support the. above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted. by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the. sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re-. review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic. tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla,. not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch. preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further. bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled. 1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan. probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x. 1. cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty. replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla not blue"".

It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted. entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""left total mastectomy long lateral. short superior"". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x. 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan. skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm. retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The. specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined slightly stellate mass (ring-. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer. quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0. x. 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the. skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the. mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is. dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses. are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately. 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue. 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect). 5D-5K-fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G= posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior. aspect. 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect, 5P-5S= anterior. aspect. 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass. 5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AC- lower outer quadrant. 5AD- lower inner quadrant. 5AE- upper inner quadrant. 5AF-upper outer quadrant.

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum.

Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
