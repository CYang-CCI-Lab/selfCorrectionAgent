Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

There is moderate nuclear staining in 60% of tumor. cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is positive for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block F8 using the CB11. monocional antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a. scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1H (left segmental mastectomy @ 2:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, this specimen is. not amplified. Although amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene. and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The. average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was. 2.44. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.
