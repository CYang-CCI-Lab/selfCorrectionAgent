Fish Ordered: Yes on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%.

Resident Physician: Attending Pathologist: I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have. rendered the above diagnosis(es). Procedures/Addenda: Addendum. Addendum. The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. immunohistochemical studies. Estrogen receptor (1. 1, clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 94%. Progesterone receptor t. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Negative. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 0%. HER2/neu (. clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Positive (overexpressed). Computer-assisted quantitative score: 3+ (see note). NOTE: This block (A5) includes areas that show morphologies similar to both the superficial and deep cores. ER and PR are. relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor, regardless of morphology. Immunostain for HER2 is heterogeneous, but. staining does not correlate with any particular morphology. There is enough strong complete staining to interpret the. HER2 as 3+ (overexpressed); however, areas in this block range from no staining to strong and complete staining. Site: right breast. Performed on block: A5. Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE. HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2=INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION. Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show appropriate staining. Jome of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR) or. research use only (RUO) reagents. These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not. been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested.

Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies.

It. consists of a mastectomy specimen together with axillary tissue weighing 292 grams. The breast measures. 16 cm from medial to lateral, 9 cm from superior to inferior and up to 4 cm from superticial to deep. There. is an overlying etlipse of dark brown skin which measures 15.5 X 7.6 cm. Slightly medially located within. the skin is a circumscribed 2.5 cm areola and a protuberant 0.6 cm nipple. The skin is unremarkable,. Axillary tissue is present and measures 15 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth facial tissue, is. inked black. In the central lateral portion of the deep margin, there is a 3 X 0.5 cm band of skeletal muscle. which is indicated by the surgeon as pectoralis major behind the tumor. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a relatively well-circumscribed, firm,. tan-white tumor mass beginning directly underneath the nipple and extending laterally within the breast,.

Additional pathologic findings: Apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular. hyperplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia. MD,. Source of Specimen: Right Breast total mastectomy. Clinical History/Operative Dx: Right breast cancer. Gross Description: The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. It. consists of a modified radical mastectomy which weighs 2,220 grams. Overall, the specimen measures 28. x 23 x 6 cm. There is an overlying broad ellipse of brown skin measuring 30 X 19.5 cm. Centrally and. slightly superiorly within the skin, there is a 7.5 cm areola and a protuberant 1.5 cm nipple. The. peripheral skin displays five sharply delineated dark brown, smooth, shiny papules. The anterior-superior. margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists. of smooth facial tissue, is inked black. Axillary tissue is present with at stitch marking the axilla. The. axillary tail measures 10 x 5 X 2 cm. in the lower outer quadrant of the breast, there is palpably firm and. hemorrhagic breast parenchyma which is very poorly delineated. There is some bright yellow. discoloration of the associated fatty tissue. This area of firm fibrous parenchyma involves an area. Printed: This report continues.

Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.
