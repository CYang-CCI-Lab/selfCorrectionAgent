Therefore, we cannot classify this tumor as T2 based on size alone.\\n\\nThe report mentions that 2 out of 12 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis in the hilar region. However, lymph node involvement is not considered in determining the T stage, so this information does not affect our T stage classification.\\n\\nBecause the report does not provide sufficient information to classify the tumor as T1, T2, or T3, we cannot make a definitive T stage classification.

There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML).

Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled "Lung Bx, frozen section\' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient\'s details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent.

MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation identified. Bronchial resection margin clear, peri-hilar margin closely approached. Perihilar lymph node involved by direct extension of tumour. Remaining hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal nodes not involved by tumour. Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema and foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Pathological stage: T4 N1 M1.

Additionally, the tumor involves a hilar lymph node by direct extension, which also supports a T4 stage. The tumor does not invade any other specific structures mentioned in the T4 category such as the heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, or carina, but the presence of mediastinal invasion is sufficient for a T4 stage. The tumor also has focal visceral pleural invasion, but this alone is not enough to determine the T stage as it is also present in T2 and T3 stages. The absence of unequivocal lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, or perineural permeation supports a T4 stage as these features would typically upgrade the T stage to T4b in the 8th edition. The bronchial resection margin is clear, but the perihilar margin is closely approached, which does not affect the T stage determination. The tumor also abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe and tumor abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact, but this is not enough to determine the T stage as it is unclear if the diathermy artefact represents true tumor invasion.

MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation identified. Bronchial resection margin clear, peri-hilar margin closely approached. Perihilar lymph node involved by direct extension of tumour. Remaining hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal nodes not involved by tumour. Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema and foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Pathological stage: T4 N1 M1. T-28000 M-81403 P1-03000.\n\nPlease:\n1. Explain your reasoning step by step, strictly applying these AJCC 7th edition rules.\n2. Provide your final predicted T stage (T1, T2, T3, or T4).\n'}]

Margins of resection: Negative. Direct extension of tumor: Absent. Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative. Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative. Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative. Regional lymph nodes (pN): One of seven peribronchial lymph nodes. contains metastatic carcinoma. All sampled mediastinal nodes are. negative (pN1). Distant metastasis (pM): pMX. Other findings: Subpleural fibrosis and focal emphysematous. changes. DIAGNOSIS. A. Lung, left upper lobectomy: Invasive moderate to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumor is confined to the lung without involvement of. the visceral pleural surface. Bronchial margin of resection is free of tumor. One of seven peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic. adenocarcinoma.(1/7). B. Lymph node, level 5, resection: Negative for malignancy. C. Lymph node, level 11, resection: No lymph node tissue is present; negative for malignancy. D. Lymph node, level 9, resection: Negative for malignancy. E.
