The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the. specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Medially and. inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The. breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area. of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral,. 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep.

The breast has an. overlying 22.0 x 8.5 cm portion of tan-white skin. The skin has a central 6.5 x 5.5 cm. areola and 1.5 cm raised nipple. There is a green suture on the skin designating 12. o'clock. An indurated nodule is present beneath the skin surface directly medial to the. nipple and underlying the areola. The skin surface and areola have multiple plaque-like. pigmented papules. The largest papule is superior and lateral at the edge of the areola. This papule is 1.6 x 0.8 cm. No additional scars or lesions are identified on the skin. surface The deep margin is ragged and fatty. The specimen is consistent with a simple. mastectomy specimen. The deep margin is inked blue, and the breast is sectioned to have a diffusely glistening. fatty. cut surface. À medial, 2.3 cm nodular tumor mass is present beneath the skin surface. medial in the described area beneath the areola. The tumor has a focal multinodular. appearance at the periphery. but appears to be one mass grossly The mass is 0.7 cm from. the. skin surface, is 6.0 cm from superior, is 3.0 cm from inferior. is 5.0 cm from medial. and 18. 5 cm from lateral. The tumor is at least 4.5 cm from the deep margin. The tumor. has a central stellate, gritty indurated cut surface, and further sectioning shows the. tumor to range up to 2.8 cm. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking The. remainder of the parenchyma is diffusely fatty with scant, delicate white fibrous tissue. No additional tumor-like masses are identified.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43.

Clinical History: The patient is a. year-old female with breast cancer undergoing left breast. modified radical mastectomy. Comment. The tumor exhibits 20% cellularity. Although extensive hyalinization is present. in the tumor bed, this feature was also seen on the pre-treatment biopsy. Hence,. response to chemotherapy is difficult to assess. Of note, no significant. treatment response is seen in the lymph nodes. Specimens Received: A: Left breast modified radical mastectomy. Gross Description: A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number, and additionally identified as, 'left breast. modified radical mastectomy'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1,276.6. gm modified radical mastectomy specimen. The specimen is received oriented with. a suture designating left axillary tail. The specimen measures 26.5 cm from. superior to inferior, 27.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior to. posterior. There is an attached 9.5 X 9 x 2.5 cm axillary tail. On the. anterior surface is a 23.5 X 13 cm tan-white ellipse of skin with a 6 x 5 cm. areola and a 1.1 X 1 cm flattened nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no. evidence of ulceration or retraction. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue;. inferior edge - green;. posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 21 slices to. reveal a firm, bulging, scallop tan-white to pink 8.5 X 6.5 X 4.2 cm mass in. slices 5-13. The mass is 0.7 cm from posterior margin (black) and 0.5 cm from. anterior skin. A biopsy tract filled with gel is present in places 6-7, with. clip present in slice 7. The remainder of the specimen consists of. approximately 5% dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 95% lobulated. yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown, rubbery lymph. nodes ranging from 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.4- 2 X 0.9 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Breast specimens are fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72. hours. Block summary: A1: mass closest approach to posterior margin (black), slice 13. A2: mass, slice 12.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

Numerous focuses of carcinoma ductale in situ (DCIS) found within tumour (solid type, with medium nuclear atypia. and comedo necrosis, 30% of the tumour). Invasio carcinomatosa vasorum. Mamilla sine laesionibus. Normal parenchyma in the glandular tissue. Axillary lymph nodes. Metastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis (No II / XVII). Histopathological Diagnosis: Carcinoma ductale invasivum mammae sinistrae. Invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast.) 1. Metastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis axillae (No II/XVII). Cancer metastases in axillary lymph nodes (No II/XVII). (NHG2, pT2, pNIa). Results of immunohistochemical examination: Estrogen receptors found in over 75% of neoplastic cell nuclei. Progesterone receptors found in over 75% of neoplastic cell. nuclei. HER2 protein stained with Ventana's Pathway HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody. Negative reaction in. invasive cancerous cells ( Score = 1+).",BRCA,1,True,"The T stage is determined by the largest dimension of the tumor, which in this case is 4.3 cm. This falls within the T2 category, which is for tumors with a maximum dimension between 2.1 and 5 cm.","T stage is determined by the largest dimension of the tumor, unless the product of the three dimensions exceeds the threshold
For breast cancer, the T stage threshold for T2 is 2 cm
T stage does not consider the number of tumors, only the largest dimension
T stage does not consider the grade of the tumor
T stage does not consider the receptor status of the tumor
If the product of the three dimensions exceeds the threshold, the T stage is determined by the largest dimension
The T stage is determined by the largest confluent tumor size for multiple tumors that are connected
Tumor size is the maximum dimension of the tumor, unless the product of the three dimensions exceeds the threshold
Tumor size is the maximum dimension of the largest confluent tumor for multiple tumors that are connected
Tumor size does not consider the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
Tumor size does not consider biopsy site changes or the involvement of the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall
The T stage is based on the largest invasive tumor size, not including DCIS or non-invasive components
Tumor size is the greatest dimension of the tumor for breast cancer
T stage is determined by the largest dimension of the tumor, even if there are multiple tumors
T stage does not consider lymph node involvement
Tumor size is the greatest dimension of the largest invasive carcinoma, not including DCIS or non-invasive components
Subcategories of T1 (T1a, T1b, T1c) are determined by the exact size of the tumor within the T1 range (2 cm or less)
T2 category is for tumors with a maximum dimension between 2.1 and 5 cm
The T stage is based on the largest invasive tumor size, regardless of the presence of multiple tumors
T stage does not consider the presence of fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, or atypical hyperplasia
Tumor size is the greatest dimension of the tumor, even if there are multiple tumors, and does not consider the product of the three dimensions
T stage does not consider the surgical procedure performed
T stage is determined by the value specified in the pathology report
