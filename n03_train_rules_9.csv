An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed by manual. morphometry on block F3. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed. that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All. carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of. immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. HER2/neu.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. This modified radial mastectomy specimen contains two. foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The larger is in the. mid-medial portion measuring 3.8 cm. The smaller one is in the. lower outer quadrant, 6.5 cm lateral to the larger tumor. Morphologically, they are quite similar and both of high grade. Between the tumors, lymphovascular space invasion is present without. parenchymal invasion. The smaller tumor is also associated with. high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. It is likely, therefore, that. these two foci represent separate primaries, even though there. remains a possibility that the smaller tumor is metastatic. Please. see the template below. The template incorporates the findings on. both of the tumors. Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Both tumors are poorly differentiated.

The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a relatively well-circumscribed. firm,. tan-white tumor mass beginning directly underneath the nipple and extending laterally within the breast. This tumor mass measures 4,7 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 em from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm from. superticial to deep. This neoplasm is 3.5 cm from the closest medial margin, 5 cm from the axillary tail,. 2.5 cm from the closest superior margin, and 2.2 cm from the closest inferior margin. Centrally, it is grossly. 0.2 cm from the closest deep margin and does not appear to extend into the small strip of pectoralis. muscle. The remainder of the breast is composed of soft fatty tissue without other palpable masses. Representative tumor and adjacent breast parenchyma are obtained for research purposes. In the medial. portion of the axillary tail, there is a prominent firm 1.5 cm lymph node suspicious for metastatic. involvement.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ""left modified. radical mastectomy"" is a 1758 gram, 28.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is. received with an 11. 0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical. mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse which has a centrally. located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid areola and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are. identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands. of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated. nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to inferior. The nodule extends to cover a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this. region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass, The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the. solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the. indurated nodularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The. measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior, the mass is. approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage. associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy The dense, white-fibrous. tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly. central and inferior within the breast with finger-like, indurated extensions into each. quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant The axilla. is. sectioned to have multiple, indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a. linear 5. 0 x 0 x 1.0 cm Representative sections are sampled as labeled: 1. nipple trisected. 2. en face section of areola. 3. deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled. 4-7. sections of described solid tumor mass. 8. section of possible tumor extension abutting inked, inferior,. peripheral margin. 9. sections of upper outer quadrant biopsy cavity. 10. sections from upper outer quadrant. 11. lower outer quadrant sampled. 12. upper inner quadrant. 13. lower inner quadrant. 14-15. representative sections of two separate, large axillary lymph nodes. associated with upper outer quadrant. 16. whole lymph nodes. 17. whole lymph nodes.

Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.
