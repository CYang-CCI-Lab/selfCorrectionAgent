C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-yellow fatty tissue. measuring 5 X 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 X 0.3 x. 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 X 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest. lymph node shows foci of tan-gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely. submitted in four cassettes as follows cassette 1 - one intact and one. bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node: cassette 3 - two bisected. lymph nodes (one inked black): cassette 4 - largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A & APC. One slide is examined for each portion of the case. Both slides. demonstrate extensive lymph node involvement by poorly differentiated. carcinoma. Because of the obvious nature of this finding, it will not be. necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain. B/BPC. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without. evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of. tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy. ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3. shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of. lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-lik areas and numerous foci of. ""Indian file"" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1. mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of. tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli. and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically. active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present. within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this. lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows. no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear. inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site dre. also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6. C.

The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 X 20 X 5.5 cm and. weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is. provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng. 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No. discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified. The lymph nóde is bisected and. no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins. are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions. of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5 X 5 X 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections. of. mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants;. cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin;. cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions. B/BPC. The specimen consists of one portion of tan-yellow adipose tissue,. measuring 5 X 4 X 2 cm. The specimen has been bisected in pathology. consultation. The specimen is serially sectioned and four possible lymph. nodes. ranging from 0.5 CID to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, are identifted. The two largest lymph nodes appear to be involved by neoplasm.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A, B/BPC, & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined. Sections from. specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular. carcinoma, focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size is. difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evident. tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by. carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to bé accurate as. a. true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node. sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/BPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma. morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence of. extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph. nodes. T: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A, B/8PC & C. RIGHT BREAST?

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): High-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with areas of. matrix-producing carcinoma (subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma). Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIB. Lymphovascular invasion: Identified near periphery of tumor. Margin status: Negative (RO). Printed: This report continues (FINAL). FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of. high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell. morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid. (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor-. associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as. sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells. present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible. with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for. p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in. accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy. In addition,. some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in. metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of. differentiation towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for. and S100. are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a. portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm. does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is. granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the. fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has. some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant. cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the. carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma. has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered. less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to. distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even. though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are. significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive.

There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako. following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunoristochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. I. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A8. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. 1. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
