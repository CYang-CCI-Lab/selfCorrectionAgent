The T3 stage applies to tumors larger than 5 cm, so this patient's tumor is classified as T3. The fact that the tumor is larger than 5 cm overrides any other factors, such as the grade or subtype of the tumor, or the number of tumors. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3.", T2.," The T stage is T2, as the tumor measures 5.2 cm in greatest dimension.

What is the N stage from this report?

The N stage is N0, as no lymph nodes are positive for tumor out of 11 examined.

What is the M stage from this report?

The M stage is not explicitly mentioned in this report, but it is assumed to be M0 if there is no mention of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the pathologic stage is T2N0M0 or IIA, based on the AJCC staging system for breast cancer."

Based on the T and N stages, the overall pathologic stage is TisN0M0, which corresponds to stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) according to the AJCC staging system.
