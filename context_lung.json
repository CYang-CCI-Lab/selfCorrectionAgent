In a few patients, however, multiple cytopatho- logic examinations of pleural (pericardial) \ufb02 uid are negative for tumor, and the \ufb02 uid is nonbloody and is not an exudate. Where these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element and the patient should be classi\ufb01 ed as M0.\n\u25cf The complete pathologic assessment of the regional lymph nodes (pN) ideally entails removal of a suf\ufb01 - cient number of lymph nodes to evaluate the highest pN category. \u25cf If pathologic assessment of lymph nodes reveals nega- tive nodes but the number of lymph node stations examined are fewer than suggested above, classify the N category as pN0. \u25cf Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are single tumor cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest dimen- sion that are usually detected by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. Cases with ITC in lymph nodes or at distant sites should be classi\ufb01 ed as N0 or M0, respec- tively. The same applies to cases with \ufb01 ndings suggestive of tumor cells or their components by non-morphologic techniques such as \ufb02 ow cytometry or DNA analysis. \u25cf The following classi\ufb01 cation of ITC may be used: pN0 No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, no examination for ITC pN0(i\u2212) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, negative morphological \ufb01 ndings for ITC pN0(i+) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive morphological \ufb01 ndings for ITC FIGURE 25.2.

Pathologic staging depends on the proven anatomic extent of disease, whether or not the primary lesion has been completely removed. If a biopsied primary tumor technically cannot be removed, or when it is unreasonable to remove it, and if the highest T and N categories or the M1 category of the tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for pathologic classi\ufb01 cation and staging have been satis\ufb01 ed without total removal of the primary cancer. Basis for Current Revisions to the Lung Cancer Staging System. The 6th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual , introduced in 2002, made no changes to the previous edition with regards to lung cancer. The proposals for lung cancer staging in the 5th edition, published in 1997, were based on a relatively small database of 5,319 cases of NSCLC accumulated since 1975 by Dr. Clifton Mountain at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). During this time, there had been many re\ufb01 nements to the techniques available for clinical staging, principally the routine use of computed tomography and more recently, an increasing use of positron emission tomography. The database was largely FIGURE 25.3. The IASLC lymph node map shown with the proposed amalgamation of lymph node levels into zones."
