Isolated tumor cells are defined as small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm, or single cells, or clusters of fewer than 200 cells in a single histologic cross-section. This is consistent with the AJCC 'pT3N0(i+)(sn)' staging information provided."

Intensity: 3+. % Tumor Staining: 100%. Fish Ordered: No. METHODOLOGY. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,. HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. ). Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines with mign, low and regative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this. patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

A well-healed 3.0 cm scar. is noted just superior to the areola in the upper inner quadrant. The. specimen includes an axillary tail which measures 11.0 cm x 7.0 cm. The. margins of the specimen are inked in blue, and the specimen is serially. sectioned to reveal a 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm tumor in the upper inner quadrant,. extending medially to the upper outer quadrant. The tumor is firm,. tannish-white, with a gritty consistency. It appears to be infiltrating. adjacent tissue. Tissue has been sent for estrogen and progesterone receptor. assays. The tumor approaches to 1 cm of the deep margin. It approaches to. 1.0 cm to the lateral margins. The remainder of the breast tissue is composed. of lobular adipose tissue intermixed with reddish pink fibrous tissue. There. is an area of dense white fibrous breast tissue in the upper outer quadrant. The axillary tail measures 13.5 x 8.0 cm. It is composed of yellow lobular. adipose tissue. Several nodes are identified grossly. A 3.1 x 1.0 cm node is. sectioned to reveal a firm 2.0 x 1.0 cm tan-white mass.

'non-sentinel node left axilla\" and consists of a single fatty node. measuring 0.7 cm. Bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC frozen section control. 4.) The specimen is received fresh labeled, \"Left total mastectomy, suture. marks axillary aspect\" and consists of a previously incised, 24.1 x 19.5 x. 4.6 cm breast with a partially overlying, 11.7 x 3.5 x 0.1 cm skin ellipse. Situated centrally on the skin surface is a 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.1 cm, crusty,. partially inverted, diffusely indurated, nipple with smooth, pink-white. suspicious cut surfaces surrounded by a 4.7 x 3.4 cm areola. The wrinkled,. tan-white skin is free of any gross abnormalities. A suture demarcates the. 7.2 x 4.6 x 0.5 cm axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is. inked black, the anterior blue and the axillary aspect is inked yellow. The. specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8 x 2.4 x 2.1 cm, firm, lobular. to fatty infiltrating bordered, pink-white mass, located in the lower inner. and outer quadrants, from 5 ''clock to 7 o'clock, underlying the nipple, 0.5. cm from the nipple base and 3.6 cm from the deep margin, (designated Mass. #1) The mass grossly appears to be separate from the suspicious indurated. nipple. Also, 5.9 cm superior and 1.5 cm medial to Mass #1, is a 2.5 x 2.2. x 1.3 cm, biopsy site partially surrounded by moderately dense, focally;. cystic, nodular and hemorrhagic, white fibrous tissue, located within the. apper outer quadrant, at 1 o'clock, 5.1 cm the nipple and 3.2 cm from the. deep margin, (designated Biopsy site #1) In addition, partially abutting. biopsy site #1 is a twist-clip situated within a 2.6 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm. well-healed biopsy site with a peripherally attached 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm,. ovoid, firm, smooth to nodular bordered, white to indigo blue ink-tinged. mass, located within the upper outer quadrant, at 2 o'clock, 5.5 cm from the. nipple and 4.2 cm the deep margin (designated Biopay site #2 and Mass #2). The remaining breast parenchyma consists of lobules of yellow adipose. separated by bands of mild to moderately dense, focally nodular and cystic,. white fibrous tissue. Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grosalv. identifiable lymph nodes. TPS is submitted of Mass #1, per protocol. Representative sections are submitted. Additional sections are submitted. following microscopic review of the specimen. Summary of sections: N - nipple. NB - nipple base. D - deep margin. M1 Mass #1. BX1 Biopsy site #1.

GROSS EXAMINATION: A. \"Left breast mass (Af1)' \". Received is a breast biopsy specimen and frozen. section remnant. The breast tissue measures 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The surgeon. states that the margin is not important, thus the specimen is not inked. Sectioning of the specimen reveals a red-brown nodule measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x. 1.5 cm. Tissue from the nodule has been sent for ER/PR study. A remnant of. frozen section of the red-brown tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm is. submitted in toto in Block A1, with representative sections of the nodule. submitted in Blocks A2-A4. B. \"Left breast\", fresh. An 18 x 25 x 6 cm breast mastectomy specimen with a. 23 x 14 cm skin ellipse and a 12 x 9.5 cm axillary tail. The skin ellipse is notable for a grossly unremarkable nipple and areola and a. 5.5 cm recently dehised biopsy scar located in the lower medial portion of the. ellipse. The deep surface of the breast specimen is inked in black. Cut sectioning. through the breast reveals a 5 x 4 x 4 cm hollow biopsy cavity in the lower. medial quadrant which is lined by smooth white tissue in its cavity. The. cavity comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked distal surface, 0.8 cm from the. inked posterior surface, and 12 cm from the inked proximal surface. There is. a focal 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm firm, finely granular, grey-pink lesion located. adjacent to the lateral tip of the biopsy cavity. This lesion is, at its. closest points, 1.5 cm from the distal inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior. inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior inked surface, 11 cm from the proximal. inked surface, and 2 cm beneath the anterior skin surface. The remainder of. breast specimen is comprised of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue with an. especially prominent white fibrous focus in the upper midportion of breast. parenchyma. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1 representative section of nipple. B2-B5 tissue around biopsy cavity site which includes firm lesion described. above.

Given the information available, I would start with an N0 prediction, but it's crucial to wait for the final pathology report with the number of positive lymph nodes to accurately determine the N stage. Since the report mentions 11 negative lymph nodes, we know that the N stage will be N0, N1, or N2, but not N3, as N3 requires 10 or more positive axillary lymph nodes or metastasis in the infraclavicular lymph nodes, neither of which are mentioned in the report."

However, rule R5 states that if there is extracapsular extension in the axillary lymph nodes, the N stage is N2 or higher. Although the report does not explicitly mention extracapsular extension, it's important to note that not all pathology reports will specifically mention its presence or absence. Given the lack of explicit information about extracapsular extension and the fact that there is metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes (even though they were all found in the specimen), the N stage would be N1 based on rule R2. If there was extracapsular extension, the N stage would be N2 based on rule R5, but the report does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, we can only predict the N stage as N1 based on the available information."

Therefore, the patient falls under the N2 category: 'Metastasis is found in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically positive axillary nodes that are fixed or matted, or in inframammary nodes, or in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes with associated ipsilateral internal mammary nodes with clinically negative axillary nodes.' Though the report does not explicitly state that the axillary nodes are fixed or matted, the presence of extracapsular extension in the sentinel node suggests a more advanced disease, and the N2 category is the closest fit."

The specimen is. partially covered by a 21.1 x 9.9 cm ellipse of tan skin. Eccentrically located is a non-retracted nipple surrounded by areola complex, 2.8 cm In diameter. The specimen Is Inked and sectioned to display a circumscribed tan white fibrous appearing nodule, 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.7 cm. The lesion is 0.7 cm from the. deep inked margin. The remainder of the cut surface displays at least 50% interspersed blue-pink fibrous tissue. Additional lesions are nonidentified. The axiliary contents measure 8.2 x 5.5 x 1.7 cm. On sectioning and palpation, nine lymph nodes are kdenufled ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 cm in greatest. dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1--nipple; 2-lesion to inked margin; 3 and 4-additional sections of tesion; 5--uninvolved tissue lower. outer quadrant; 6-upper outer quadrant; 7-upper Inner quadrant; 8--lower inner quadrant; 9 and 10--individual nodes in each casselte; 11-one node. bisected; 12-two whole nodes.

B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the -. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu. /CEP17. Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

The minimum N stage would be N1, as the report does not mention 10 or more axillary lymph nodes being involved (which would be required for N3) or 4 or more axillary lymph nodes (which would be required for N2). So, the N stage is most likely N1 or lower, but we cannot definitively say it is N0 without information about any involved lymph nodes."
