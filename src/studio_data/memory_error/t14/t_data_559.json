Since this tumor is 2.1 cm, it is slightly larger than a T1 tumor. However, since the T stage is determined by the largest tumor size and the report does not indicate any T2, T3, or T4 characteristics, we can assume that the tumor is staged as T1 due to its proximity to the 2 cm cutoff."

According to the TNM staging system, T2 stage is assigned when the tumor size is more than 2 cm and not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
