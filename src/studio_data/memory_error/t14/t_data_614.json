However, the report states that the tumor size is 2.3 cm, which is slightly over 2 cm. But, since the difference is very small and the T stage categories are in whole centimeters, we can round down to the nearest whole centimeter and classify this tumor as T1. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T1."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 designation is given to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Since the tumor size in this report is 2.3 cm, the T stage would be T2."
