The report mentions 'Twelve benign lymph nodes (0/12)' for the additional level II dissection and 'Three benign lymph nodes (0/3)' for the level II and III dissection. This indicates that none of the assessed lymph nodes had metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0, as per New Rules 10 and 11."

However, there is extranodal tumor extension (>2 mm) in one or more lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage is N2."
