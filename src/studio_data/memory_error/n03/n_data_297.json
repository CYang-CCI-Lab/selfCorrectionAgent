This is stated in the microscopic description as 'AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. Lymphonodulitis chronica et sinus histiocytosis et lipomatosis lymphonodorum (No XIV)'. This corresponds to the new rules 10 and 11, where N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is pNO, based on the information provided in the report. It's important to note that the N stage is not one of the traditional N0, N1, N2, or N3 stages, but rather a pathologic N stage (pN) indicating no metastases in the lymph nodes."
