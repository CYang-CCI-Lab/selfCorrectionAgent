Based on Rule 13, N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. In this case, the presence of metastases in a regional lymph node (subclavicular) qualifies the N stage as N3."

The report does not mention extracapsular invasion, so we cannot consider that in the staging. The substaging information is not provided, so we cannot make a more specific N1 substage prediction."
