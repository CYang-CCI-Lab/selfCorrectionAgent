Based on the given rules, N0 indicates no positive lymph nodes or no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. The report only mentions that surgical margins are positive for carcinoma, but it does not provide enough information to determine the N stage. Therefore, the N stage is most likely N0."

This suggests that cancer has spread to the lymphatic system, but it has not reached the skin. The absence of tumor in dermal lymphatics indicates that the cancer has not spread to the skin, which is a factor used to determine the N stage. Therefore, based on the information provided, the patient's N stage would be N1."
