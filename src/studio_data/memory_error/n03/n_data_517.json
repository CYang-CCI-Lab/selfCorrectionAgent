The addendum mentions metastatic carcinoma in the form of microscopic clusters and single cells (micrometastasis) identified on cytokeratin immunohistochemical stains only, but it does not specify the number of positive lymph nodes. According to the new rules 10 and 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

Additionally, there is one isolated cytokeratin-positive cell present in another sentinel lymph node (part #2). This information indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, so the N stage is N1."
