Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2. This is consistent with the rules provided, as the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The report also specifies that the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which follows the same rules as invasive lobular carcinoma for staging purposes."

There is also a separate microscopic focus of invasive tumor, but since it is smaller than 2 cm, it does not affect the T stage. The T stage is primarily based on the size of the largest tumor."
