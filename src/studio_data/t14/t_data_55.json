Based on the rules provided, this would correspond to a T3 tumor. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."

                "text": "The report indicates that the tumor is a 11.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm mass, which extensively involves the breast. This is consistent with a pathologic T3 (pT3) stage, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded the surrounding tissue. In this case, the large size of the tumor (>5 cm) indicates a T3 stage."
