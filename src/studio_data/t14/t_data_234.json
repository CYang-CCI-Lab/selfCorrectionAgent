The tumor is classified as a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of focal in situ spread and neuroendocrine characteristics does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer, a T2 designation is given to tumors that measure between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm in size. Therefore, based on the information provided in this report, the patient's cancer has a pathologic T stage of T2."
