The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of multifocality does not affect the T stage. The T stage is also not affected by the tumor grade, lymph node involvement, or the presence of angioinvasion. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded the chest wall or skin. In this report, the larger tumor is 5.3 cm, which is larger than the 5 cm threshold for a T3 stage. The report also mentions 'further invasive tumor components in the quadrant of the sample excision cavity and retromamillary (maximum surface spread: 0.8 cm)', which suggests that the tumor has invaded the chest wall, which is also indicative of a T3 stage. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T3."
