This meets the criteria for a T4 tumor, as it is of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T4."

In this report, the tumor diameter is 17 cm, which is significantly larger than the threshold for T3 (5 cm). Additionally, the report states that the tumor has invaded the skin, indicated by the 'pT4bp' component of the classification. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."
