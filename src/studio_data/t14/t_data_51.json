The T3 stage is used for tumors that are larger than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm in size. The report also mentions that the tumor is multicentric and involves the central, inferior, and areas previously biopsied (12:00 and 9:30 aspects of right breast), which supports the classification of the tumor as T3."
