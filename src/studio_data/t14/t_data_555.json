The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The T stage is determined by the greatest diameter of the tumor, which in this case is 4.5 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2-5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
