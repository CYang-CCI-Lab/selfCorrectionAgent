In this report, the tumor size is specified as 55 mm, which is larger than the threshold for T3 (greater than 50 mm). The report also mentions 'completely circumscribed invasion of the lymph vessels' but does not indicate chest wall or skin invasion. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T3."
