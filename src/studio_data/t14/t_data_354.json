The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
