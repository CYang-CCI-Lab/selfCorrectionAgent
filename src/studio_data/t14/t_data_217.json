The tumor diameter is also given as 105 cm, which is well above the threshold for T3 tumors. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the T4b classification takes precedence over the size information. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."

                "text": "The T stage for a cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue. In this report, the tumor is described as 'invasive ductal carcinoma' with a diameter of 105 cm, and it has invaded the skin, as indicated by 'focal ulceration of the skin' and 'a satellite node in the skin'. These findings support a T4 stage, which is assigned when the tumor has invaded the chest wall or the skin. The specific subcategory of T4b is used when the tumor has directly invaded the skin. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T4."
