In this report, it is mentioned that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma formed a mass with the greatest dimension of 2.3 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
