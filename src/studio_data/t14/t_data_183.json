The tumor type is invasive lobular carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer, a T2 designation is given to tumors that measure between 2.0 and 5.0 cm in size. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
