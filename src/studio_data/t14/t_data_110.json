The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, and in this case, the report specifies that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is one of the types of breast cancer where the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the patient was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma and the T stage is reported as T2. Therefore, it can be inferred that the tumor size falls within the range of 2-5 cm, making the T stage T2."
