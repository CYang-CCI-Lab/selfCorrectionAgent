                "text": "The report indicates that there are two separate tumors in the right breast, both of which are invasive lobular carcinoma. The largest tumor is located in the lower outer quadrant and has a greatest dimension of 1.2 cm. This measurement is taken from the previous biopsy specimen, which suggests that the tumor size was measured more accurately in that specimen. The report also mentions that the tumor involves the inked superficial margin (B2), indicating that the tumor is close to the surface of the breast. Based on the rules provided, a tumor with a greatest dimension of 1.2 cm would be classified as T1c. The presence of multicentric tumors, the involvement of the superficial margin, and the measurement of the tumor size from the previous biopsy specimen all support this prediction."

                "text": "The report indicates that there are two separate tumors in the right breast, both of which are invasive lobular carcinoma, low nuclear grade. The largest tumor is located in the lower outer quadrant and has a greatest dimension of 1.2 cm. This tumor is measured from the previous biopsy specimen, and it is not clear if this measurement includes any associated non-cancerous tissue. However, the report specifically states that the tumor stage is Tlc, which corresponds to a tumor size of 1.1-2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."
