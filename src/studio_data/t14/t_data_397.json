This is consistent with a T2 tumor, which is defined as a tumor that is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, the largest focus of the invasive ductal breast carcinoma measures 3 cm, which falls in the T2 category. The T2 category includes tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
