The size of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the report, but it does mention that 'the superficial aspect of the tumor extends into the dermis' and 'the deep margin is free of tumor by a distance of 10 mm for a superficial to deep size of 35 mm'. Based on the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Given that the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is used to determine the T stage, and the deep margin measurement suggests a size of at least 3.5 cm (35 mm), the T stage for this report is most likely T2."

The largest size of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but the size of the specimen is given as 26 x 18.5 x 5.5 cm. The T stage for invasive breast cancer is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. Based on the information provided, the tumor is at least 2 cm in size, which falls under the T2 category (T2: 2.0 cm or more in size). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
