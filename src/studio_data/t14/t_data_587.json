The tumor size in this report is 5.5 cm, which falls under the T3 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T3."

According to the TNM staging system, a T3 stage is assigned when the tumor is larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
