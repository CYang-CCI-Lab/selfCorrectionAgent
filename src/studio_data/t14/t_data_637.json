The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor is 3 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors with a size of 2-5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
