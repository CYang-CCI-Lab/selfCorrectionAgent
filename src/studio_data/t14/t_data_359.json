According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, since the tumor size is 1.7 cm, it falls under the T1 category. Furthermore, the report specifies that the tumor is 'pT 1c', which confirms the T1c stage. The T1 stage is divided into three substages (T1a, T1b, and T1c) based on tumor size, but the rules provided do not include these substages. However, the 'pT 1c' stage provided in the report takes these substages into account, and it is the most valid T stage from the report."

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, T1 is divided into three subcategories: T1mi (microinvasion 0.1 cm or less), T1a (tumor size >0.1 cm but \u22640.5 cm), T1b (tumor size >0.5 cm but \u22641 cm), T1c (tumor size >1 cm but \u22642 cm). Since the largest focus of invasive carcinoma is 1.7 cm, the T stage is T1c."
