In this pathology report, the size of the tumor is stated as having a greatest dimension of 7.5 cm (T3). The report also mentions that the tumor extends within 26 mm of the nearest deep inked surgical margin, but this does not affect the T stage as it is only used for determining the close margin status. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
