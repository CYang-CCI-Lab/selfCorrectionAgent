The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."

The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor, and in this case, the report clearly states that the tumor diameter is 9 cm. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T3."
