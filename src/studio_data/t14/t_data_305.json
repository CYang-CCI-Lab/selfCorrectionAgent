The T stage is given as 2, which is a valid T stage for this type of cancer. The size of the tumor is not provided in the report, but the T stage is already specified as T2. The N stage is 1, and the M stage is 0, indicating no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis. The treatment is none, and the tissue specimen was obtained via radical mastectomy. The grade is 2. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that measures between 2-5 cm in its greatest dimension. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report mentions that the patient underwent a radical mastectomy and the grade of the tumor is 2, it can be inferred that the tumor was larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which would make the T stage T2."
