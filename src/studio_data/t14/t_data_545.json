The largest dimension of the tumor is 2.3 cm, which falls within the range for T2 tumors (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures. In this report, the macroscopic description states that the tumor cross section is 1.7 x 1.5 x 2.3 cm. The microscopic description then confirms that the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma and gives a pathologic T stage of pT2. This is consistent with a tumor size of greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in the greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
