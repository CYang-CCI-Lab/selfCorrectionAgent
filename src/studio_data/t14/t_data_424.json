The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, ignoring any substaging information. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."

In this report, it is stated that the maximum dimension of the invasive carcinoma is 2.0 cm. The T stage is defined as follows: T1: Tumor 2.0 cm or less in size; T2: Tumor more than 2.0 cm in size; T3: Tumor more than 5.0 cm in size; T4: Tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the report, the T stage for this patient is T1c."
