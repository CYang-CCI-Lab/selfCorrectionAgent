According to the rules provided, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor is less than 5 cm and there is no mention of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, the T stage must be T1, T2, or T2 with substaging information. However, since the report does not provide any substaging information, we cannot determine if it is T1 or T2. The report also states that the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
