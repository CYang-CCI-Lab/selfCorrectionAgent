                "text": "The report mentions that the 'Site of tumour removal sized 8 x 8 x 3 cm' was found in the breast. Even though the exact tumor size in one dimension is not provided, the size in three dimensions is given. To determine the T stage, we need to use the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor. In this case, the largest tumor dimension can be approximated to be 8 cm (the largest of the three dimensions given). Based on the rules provided, a T1 tumor is 2 cm or less in size. Therefore, the tumor in this report is most likely a T1 tumor, as its maximum dimension is approximately 8 cm, which is larger than 2 cm but less than 5 cm (T2) or 5 cm (T3). The report does not indicate any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which would be required for a T4 classification. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis, so the pNo/sn/ notation does not affect the T stage determination. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T1."

In this case, the tumor size is less than 2 cm, which corresponds to T1 stage. The specific substaging information (T1a, T1b, T1c) is not provided in the report, so we can only determine the main T stage."
