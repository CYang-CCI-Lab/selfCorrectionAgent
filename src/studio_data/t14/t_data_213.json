In this report, the tumor size is described as having a maximum diameter of 6.5 cm (calculated by the presence of tumor in 4 consecutive 1.6 cm thick slices) in the left breast. Additionally, there is invasion of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and fibrous tissue beneath the epidermis in the left breast skin nodule. Based on these findings, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
