The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2 even though the histological type is Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."

T2 tumors are defined as those with a size between 2.1 to 5.0 cm, so a tumor of 2.1 cm would be classified as a T2 tumor."
