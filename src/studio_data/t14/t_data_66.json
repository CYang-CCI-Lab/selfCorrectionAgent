This information supports the prediction of a T4 stage, which is used to determine the T stage, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 4.5 cm, and the direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which is consistent with a T4 stage."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded the chest wall or skin. In this report, the tumor is described as having widespread infiltration of the skin, along with ulceration of the skin, and invasion of the lymph vessels and neural sheaths. These findings indicate that the tumor has invaded the chest wall or skin, which corresponds to a T4 stage. The maximum diameter of the tumor, 4.5 cm, is also consistent with a T4 stage, as this is larger than the 5 cm threshold for a T3 stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."
