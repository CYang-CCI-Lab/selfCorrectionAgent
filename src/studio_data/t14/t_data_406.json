The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report specifies that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma in the right breast. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
