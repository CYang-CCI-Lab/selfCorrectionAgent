The T stage is reported as T4, which means the tumor is of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The size of the tumor is not specified in the report, but the T stage is already reported as T4, so we don't need to use the rules to predict the T stage in this case. The T stage reported in the pathology report takes precedence over any other rules or guidelines."

The report indicates that the patient has a diagnosis of Infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is a type of invasive breast cancer. The T stage is reported as T4, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the chest wall or skin. The report does not provide information about the size of the tumor, but the T4 stage indicates that the size is not a factor in this case. The N and M stages are 0, indicating that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes or other organs."
