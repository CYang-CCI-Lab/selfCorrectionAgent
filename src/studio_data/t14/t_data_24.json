The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T2 stage is still applicable. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T2 stage is appropriate for this invasive ductal carcinoma."

According to the TNM staging system, a tumor size of 2.0 to 5.0 cm corresponds to a T2 stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
