The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T2 stage is assigned when the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size.
