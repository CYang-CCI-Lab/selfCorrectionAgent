This is based on the measurement of the largest focus in the right breast wire-guided lumpectomy specimen (E). The report also mentions that the tumor approaches margins at multiple foci throughout the specimen, but the size of the tumor in relation to the margins is not provided. Therefore, the T stage can be determined as T1c based on the size of the largest focus of invasive carcinoma."
