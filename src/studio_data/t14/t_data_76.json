Furthermore, the report specifies that this is a T1c tumor, which corresponds to a tumor size between 1.1 and 2 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T1c."

The T stage is determined by the size of the largest focus, so in this case, it would be T1c (1.1 to 2 cm). This is confirmed in the 'Case Synopsis' section of the report."
