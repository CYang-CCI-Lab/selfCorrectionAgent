This information indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The report also mentions that there is no angiolymphatic invasion and no significant ductal carcinoma in situ component identified. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
