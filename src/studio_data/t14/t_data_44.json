The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal) does not affect the T stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the size of the invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast is 2.3 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T2 stage is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
