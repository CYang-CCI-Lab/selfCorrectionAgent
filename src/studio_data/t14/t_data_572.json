This is smaller than the 2 cm threshold for T2 tumors, so the tumor is classified as T1. The specific T1 substage (T1a, T1b, T1c) is not relevant for the purpose of this question, which only asks for the main T stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T1 stage still applies even though the report mentions DCIS. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis, so the absence of this information in the report does not change the T stage prediction."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 1.2 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a tumor size of 1.0 cm to 2.0 cm corresponds to a T1c stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
