Based on the rules provided, a T1 tumor is 2 cm or less, a T2 tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, a T3 tumor is more than 5 cm, and a T4 tumor is of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor measures 4.8 cm, it falls into the T2 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T2 stage still applies."
