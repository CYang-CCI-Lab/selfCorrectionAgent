The T stage is given as 2, and there is no indication of T3 or T4. The N and M stages are both 0. Following the rules provided, since the report gives a T stage of 2 and there is no information suggesting a different T stage, the predicted T stage is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report mentions that the patient underwent a radical mastectomy and the grade of the tumor is 2, it can be inferred that the tumor was larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage."
