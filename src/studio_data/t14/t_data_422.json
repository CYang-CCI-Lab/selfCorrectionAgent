This puts the tumor in the T2 stage, which is defined as a tumor size of more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The presence of smaller foci (0.7 cm and 1.1 cm) does not affect the T stage, as the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

                "text": "The patient has three invasive ductal carcinoma foci in the right breast, with the largest one measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. According to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, this would classify the tumor as T2 (T2: 2.1 to 5.0 cm). The other two foci measure 0.7 cm and 1.1 cm, but the T stage is based on the size of the largest focus. Additionally, the surgical margins are negative, which supports the T2 classification."
