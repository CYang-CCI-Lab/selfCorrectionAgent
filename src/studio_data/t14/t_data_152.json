The histological type of adenocarcinoma, mucinous type, and the moderately differentiated grade do not affect the T stage determination. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component is not specified in the report, but it does not affect the T stage for this type of cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
