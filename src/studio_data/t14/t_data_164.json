Since the tumor size is less than 2 cm but greater than 1 cm, it falls under the T1c category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1c."
