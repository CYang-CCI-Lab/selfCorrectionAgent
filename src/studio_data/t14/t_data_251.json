The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report indicates that the T stage is 2. This means that the largest tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report specifies a T Stage of 2, we can infer that the tumor size falls within the range of 2-5 cm, making it a T2 stage tumor."
