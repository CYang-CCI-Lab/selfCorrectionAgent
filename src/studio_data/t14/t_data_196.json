The largest dimension of the tumor is 3.2 cm, which falls in the T2 category of cancers with tumors between 2 cm and 5 cm. The type of carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, also follows the same rules for T staging based on the largest tumor size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage is determined by the greatest diameter of the tumor, which in this case is 3.2 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor with a size of 2-5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
