The presence of a satellite tumor does not affect the T stage as it is still based on the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, the T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that measures between 2-5 cm in size. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
