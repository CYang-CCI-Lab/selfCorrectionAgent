In this report, the primary tumor is described as 'INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, moderately differentiated, Nottingham grade 2 (3+2+1=6), 2.1 cm. in. greatest dimension.' This indicates that the size of the tumor is 2.1 cm, which falls within the T2 category (tumor size > 20 mm but < 50 mm in greatest dimension) according to the TNM staging system."
