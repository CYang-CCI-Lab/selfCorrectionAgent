Since T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the smaller tumor, which measures 2 cm, falls under the T2 category. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so we ignore the larger tumor's size for this prediction. The presence of multiple tumors or the number of lymph nodes involved does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2."
