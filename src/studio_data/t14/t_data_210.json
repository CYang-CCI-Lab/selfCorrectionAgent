In this report, the primary tumor is described as a 'gray-white, firm stellate mass measuring 2.2 X 2 X 2 cm.' This indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The fact that the tumor is located 0.6 cm from the closest anterior/inferior margin also supports this classification, as it indicates that the tumor has not invaded beyond the breast tissue. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
