The report also specifies that there is no in situ component and the tumor is an infiltrating mammary carcinoma with lobular features. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so the T2 stage is the appropriate classification for this patient's cancer."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
