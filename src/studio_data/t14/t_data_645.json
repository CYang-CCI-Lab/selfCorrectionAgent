The T stage is given as 2, and there is no indication of T3 or T4. The N and M stages are both 0. Following the rules provided, since a specific T stage is given and there is no information suggesting a different stage, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is reported as T2. The grade of the tumor (grade 3) and the fact that it was removed via radical mastectomy do not impact the T stage. The N and M stages are 0, indicating that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes or distant metastasis."
