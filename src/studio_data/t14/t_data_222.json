The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm mass. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
