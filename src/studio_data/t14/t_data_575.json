The tumor type is infiltrating duct carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."

The report also mentions that there is no venous invasion, the margins are uninvolved, and there is no evidence of neo-adjuvant treatment.
