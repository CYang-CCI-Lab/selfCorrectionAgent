Since the largest tumor size is 3.0 cm, and it is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the pathologic T stage is T2, based on the rules provided. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage remains T2."
