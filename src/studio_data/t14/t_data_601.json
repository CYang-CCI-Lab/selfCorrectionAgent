According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the tumor size of 3 cm falls into the T2 category. The presence of metastasis or the number of lymph nodes involved does not affect the T stage. The tumor type is infiltrating lobular carcinoma, but this does not change the T stage determination based on size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor with a size of more than 2 cm and not more than 5 cm in its greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
