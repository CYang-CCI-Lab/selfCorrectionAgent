The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The T category is based on the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less in size, T2 being more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 being more than 5 cm, and T4 involving the chest wall or skin."
