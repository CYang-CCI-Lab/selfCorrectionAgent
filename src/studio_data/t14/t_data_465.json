The first tumor was measured as 2 x 1.8 x 2.5 cm and the second tumor was 3.2 x 1.9 x 4.5 cm. The total tumor size was calculated by adding the greatest dimensions of each tumor (2 + 4.5 = 6.5 cm). Since the T stage is based on the largest tumor size, the patient's cancer would be classified as T2 (tumor size > 2 cm and \u2264 5 cm) according to the TNM staging system."
