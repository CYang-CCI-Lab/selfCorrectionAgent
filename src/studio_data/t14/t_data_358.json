This means that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size, which aligns with the definition of T1 tumors. The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is safe to assume that the tumor is confined to its original location and does not meet the criteria for T4 tumors. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T1 stage is still applicable. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1."
