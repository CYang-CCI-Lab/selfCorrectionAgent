The T stage is given as 2, which is a valid T stage for this type of cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report provides a specific T stage of 2. Therefore, we can predict the T stage to be T2, as it is the given stage and is consistent with the rules provided."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report mentions 'Radical mastectomy' and 'T Stage: 2', it can be inferred that the tumor size falls within the T2 range. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
