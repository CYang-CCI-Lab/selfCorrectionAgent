The T stage is listed as 2, which is consistent with the rules provided. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report specifies that the T stage is 2, so that is the predicted T stage. The N stage is 1, which indicates that there is cancer in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, and the M stage is 0, which means that there are no distant metastases. The grade is 2, which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor. The treatment is listed as none, and the tissue specimen was obtained via radical mastectomy. The tissue specimen was processed as a tissue block in OCT matrix and the blood sample was obtained via blood draw and processed as a frozen sample in a tube. The type of procurement for both specimens is not specified."

According to the pathology report, the tumor was removed via a radical mastectomy and the size was not explicitly stated. However, the T stage was reported as a 'T2' in the pathology report, which is the most reliable source of information for staging."
