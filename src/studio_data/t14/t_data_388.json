The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, so the T stage is still T2."

T2 stages have tumors that are greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm in size. The T1 category is not applicable as the tumor size is greater than 2 cm. The T3 and T4 categories are not applicable based on the information provided in the report."
