The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the number of lymph nodes involved does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the size of the tumor is 3 cm (concluding diagnosis: Left breast segment at 12 o'clock with a 3 cm moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma). According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2-5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
