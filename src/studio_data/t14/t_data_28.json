Further, there is no indication of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which rules out T4. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1."

This corresponds to a T1 stage as per the TNM staging system for breast cancer. The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor, with T1 indicating a tumor size of 2 cm or less. In this case, the main lesion is 6 mm and the satellite lesion is 3.2 mm, both of which are less than 2 cm, confirming the T1 stage."
