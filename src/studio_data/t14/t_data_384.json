Tumor size: 1.5 cm), and for the right breast, the tumor size is 1.2 cm (E. Tumor size: 1.2 cm on the glass slide). Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size. Both the left and right breast tumors are less than or equal to 2 cm in size, so the T stage for both is T1."

Both of these measurements fall under T1 category, which includes tumors that are 2 cm or less in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
