The T stage for a tumor of this size, based on the TNM staging system, is T2. The T2 category is used when the tumor is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension but not larger than 5 cm. The report also mentions that the tumor is placed 2.2 cm from the lower edge, 0.3 cm from the base and 2.8 cm from the skin, but these measurements do not factor into the T stage determination."
