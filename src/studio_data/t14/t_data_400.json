Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The report does not provide a tumor size, but since there is no indication of T3 or T4, the T stage is most likely T2 for invasive lobular carcinoma. However, since the report explicitly states T1, we can assume that the tumor size is 2 cm or less, which aligns with the definition of T1 tumors."
