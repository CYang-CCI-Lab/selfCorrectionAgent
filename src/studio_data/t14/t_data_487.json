The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor is an invasive ductal carcinoma with a diameter of 2.2 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage for breast cancer is defined as follows: T1 (tumor size \u2264 2 cm), T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but \u2264 5 cm), T3 (tumor size > 5 cm), and T4 (tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
