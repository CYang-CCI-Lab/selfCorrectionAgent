There is no indication in the report that the tumor has direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is not a T4 tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The first nodule is located in the upper outer quadrant and measures 3.9 cm in largest dimension, which falls in the T2 category (T2: Tumor >2 cm but \u22645 cm in greatest dimension). The second nodule is located in the upper and lower outer quadrants at 3:00 and is composed predominantly of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with several foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, ranging in size from less than 0.1 cm to about 0.4 cm. Since the largest size of the invasive component of the second nodule is less than 3.9 cm, it does not affect the T staging. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
