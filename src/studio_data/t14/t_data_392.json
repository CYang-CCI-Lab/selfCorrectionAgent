When determining the T stage, we consider the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 3 cm. This falls within the T2 category of cancers that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2."

The larger tumor diameter is used to determine the T stage. As the larger diameter is 3 cm, which is greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, the T stage is T2, according to the TNM staging system for cancer."
