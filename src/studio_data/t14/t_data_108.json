The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so in this case, the T stage would be T2 as Mass #1 is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm."

The T stage for cancer is based on the size of the largest tumor. In this case, the largest tumor (Mass #1) is 2.5 cm, which falls under T2 (Tumor size 2.0 to 5.0 cm) according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
