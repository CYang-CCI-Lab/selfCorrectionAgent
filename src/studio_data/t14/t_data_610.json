Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Since the largest tumor size is 2.2 cm, which is more than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
