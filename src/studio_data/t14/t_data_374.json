This meets the criteria for a T3 tumor. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of skin ulceration and extranodal extension also supports the T3 stage. The number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis does not affect the T stage."
