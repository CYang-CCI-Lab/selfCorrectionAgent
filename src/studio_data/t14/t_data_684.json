The report also indicates that 'Invasive ductal carcinoma is identified within 0.2 cm of the superior skin/soft tissue margin' and 'There is ulceration of the skin by tumor. There is dermal lymphatic invasion. Carcinoma invades the skeletal muscle.' These findings further support the T4 stage. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T4."

In this report, the tumor size is given as 19 cm, which is larger than the threshold for T4 stage (greater than 5 cm). Additionally, the report states that the tumor invades the skeletal muscle and the skin, which are both indicators of T4 stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."
