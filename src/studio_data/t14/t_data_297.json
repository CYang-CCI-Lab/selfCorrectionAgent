The tumor size in this report is 6 cm, which falls into the T3 category. The fact that the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, NHG3, and there is no direct extension to the chest wall or skin, does not affect the T stage determination. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component also does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."

Additionally, it is mentioned that the tumor is placed 4 cm from the lower edge, 2.5 cm from the base and 1.3 cm from the skin. Based on the TNM staging system, a T3 stage is assigned to tumors that are larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
