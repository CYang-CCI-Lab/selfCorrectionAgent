The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2."

The report also mentions that the tumor is an infiltrating duct carcinoma, G2, and the specimen type is a radical mastectomy. The T stage is determined based on the size of the tumor, and in this case, it is T2."
