This is stated in the microscopic description section of the report: 'The previously biopsied large tumor is an infiltrating lobular carcinoma. In one 2 mm. area (block #6 within the. main tumor) , there is a focus of invasive ductal carcinoma which is. nuclear grade 1 (architectural score 1, nuclear score 2, mitotic. score 1) . In addition, in blocks 4 and 5 there is in situ tumor. which, with the help of E-Cadherin stain, proves to be ductal. carcinoma in situ, nuclear grade 2. The tumor measures 5.5 cm.' Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."

The T3 stage applies to tumors that are larger than 5 cm in size. The presence of associated infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
