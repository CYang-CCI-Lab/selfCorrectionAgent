The report also provides a T stage of 1, which is a valid T stage according to the rules provided. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient is T1. The reasoning for this prediction is based on the explicit T stage information provided in the report, which is valid and does not require further interpretation based on tumor size or other factors."

The T Stage is determined by the size of the tumor, and T1 indicates that the tumor is 2 centimeters or less in size. The report does not provide any additional information that would modify this T Stage, such as the presence of tumor extension into the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T Stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
