The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. In this pathology report, the tumor is classified as pT2, which corresponds to a tumor size of 2.1 to 5.0 cm. This is because the report mentions that the tumor is predominantly solid, moderately differentiated ductal breast carcinoma with invasive growth, and the minimum dorsal margin is less than 0.1 cm. The report also mentions that the tumor was included in the left mastectomy preparation, but it does not provide information on the exact size of the tumor. However, since the tumor was included in the mastectomy, it suggests that the tumor was larger than 2 cm, which is the minimum size for a T2 tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
