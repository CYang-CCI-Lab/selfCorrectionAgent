According to the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is most likely T2."
