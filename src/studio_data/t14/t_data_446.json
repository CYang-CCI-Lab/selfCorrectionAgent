The T stage is given as 2, which aligns with the rule that T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The N and M stages are both 0, indicating no lymph node involvement or metastasis. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the report provides a valid T stage, so there is no need to apply other rules. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that measures between 2-5 cm in its greatest dimension. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report mentions 'Radical mastectomy' and 'T Stage: 2', it can be inferred that the tumor size falls within the T2 range. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
