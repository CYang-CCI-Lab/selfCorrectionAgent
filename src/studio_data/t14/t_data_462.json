The T stage is given as 2, which is a valid T stage for this type of cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report provides a T stage of 2, so there is no need to estimate the size based on other factors. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that measures between 2-5 cm in its greatest dimension. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report mentions that the patient underwent a radical mastectomy and the grade of the tumor is 2, it can be inferred that the tumor was larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. Therefore, the T stage predicted from this report is T2."
