According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T1c specifically refers to tumors that are more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in size. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T1c."

The total tumor aggregate size is the sum of the sizes of multiple invasive tumors, which is 2.7 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so in this case, the T stage would be T1c as the largest tumor measures 1.5 cm (T1a: \u2264 0.5 cm, T1b: > 0.5 cm but \u2264 1 cm, T1c: > 1 cm but \u2264 2 cm, T2: > 2 cm but \u2264 5 cm, etc.)"
