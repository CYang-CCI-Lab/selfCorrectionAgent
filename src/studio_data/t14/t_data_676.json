The tumor type is moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The minimum distance to the dorsal margin is 0.3 cm, which indicates that the tumor has not reached the dorsal margin. The other margins are 1 cm and remain free, further supporting the T2 classification. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
