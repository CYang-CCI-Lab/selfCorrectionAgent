This is further supported by the AJCC stage IIB (T3 N0 MX) provided in the report. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T3."

According to the TNM staging system for breast cancer, a T3 designation is given to tumors that are greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
