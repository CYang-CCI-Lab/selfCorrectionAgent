This information indicates a T4 stage, regardless of the presence of lymph node involvement or other factors. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size and the presence of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which is the case here."

In this report, the tumor is described as having a diameter of 5.0 cm and having invaded the skin with foci of ulceration. This indicates that the tumor has gone beyond the breast tissue and has invaded the skin, which is classified as T4 stage. The specific subcategory of T4 (T4a, T4b, T4c, or T4d) cannot be determined from the information provided."
