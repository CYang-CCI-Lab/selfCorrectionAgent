In this report, it is mentioned that the 'INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS TYPE, HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III (SLIGHT OR NO TUBULE FORMATION) NUCLEAR GRADE III/III (MARKED VARIATION IN SIZE AND SHAPE) MEASURING 2.5 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION GROSSLY (AT LEAST 2.3 CM MICROSCOPICALLY)' which indicates that the size of the primary tumor is 2.5 cm. According to the TNM staging system for breast cancer, a T2 stage is assigned when the tumor size is between 2 cm and 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
