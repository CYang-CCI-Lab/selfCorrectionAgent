                "text": "The report provides a gross tumor size of 2.4 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm. Using the rules provided, a T1 tumor is 2 cm or less, a T2 tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and a T3 tumor is more than 5 cm. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm, the T stage is either T2 or T3. However, the report does not indicate that the tumor has direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which would be required for a T4 designation. Therefore, the T stage is most likely T2."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2.0 to 5.0 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
