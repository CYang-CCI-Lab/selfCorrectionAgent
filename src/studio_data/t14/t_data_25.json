According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size. Since the report specifies T1c, this indicates that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size, but there is some additional information about the tumor (such as the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ or lymphatic/vascular invasion) that has been denoted with the 'c'. However, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so the T stage is still T1. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T1."
