In this report, the size of the tumor is given as 4.1 x 2.6 x 4.0 cm (grossly) and the size of the invasive component is also 4.1 cm. According to the TNM staging system for breast cancer, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
