In this report, the size of the invasive micropapillary carcinoma in the right breast is given as 2.1 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
