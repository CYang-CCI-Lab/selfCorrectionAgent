The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, it is mentioned that the tumor size is 3.0 cm (3.2 cm in one place, which could be a measurement error) in the largest dimension. Therefore, the T stage is T2, as T1 is for tumors up to 2 cm, T2 is for tumors between 2 cm and 5 cm, T3 is for tumors larger than 5 cm, and T4 is for tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report also mentions that there is infiltrating carcinoma present within 1 mm of the inked superior and deep margins, but this does not affect the T stage."
