This tumor size falls within the T2 category. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, the tumor is described as forming a 2.7 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm mass. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
