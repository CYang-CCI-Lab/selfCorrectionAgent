The T stage is given as 2, which is a valid T stage according to the rules provided. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report explicitly states that the T stage is 2. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor is a grade 3 metaplastic carcinoma, which indicates a more aggressive cancer, and it measures 2 cm in its greatest dimension as it was removed by a radical mastectomy. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
