The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2 for invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, so the T stage is still T2."

Based on the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage is assigned to invasive breast cancers that measure between 2.1 and 5 cm in size. Therefore, the patient's T stage is T2."
