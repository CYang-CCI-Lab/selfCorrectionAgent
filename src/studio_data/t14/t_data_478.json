The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is used to determine the T stage, which in this case is 40 mm. Therefore, the T stage is T2."

In this report, the largest focus of the invasive lobular carcinoma is 40 mm, which falls in the T2 category. The T2 category includes tumors that are greater than 20 mm in size but not greater than 50 mm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
