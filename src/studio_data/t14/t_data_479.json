Since the largest dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is 1.9 cm, which is less than 2 cm, the T stage is T1. Furthermore, the 'c' substage indicates that the tumor is between 1.1 and 2.0 cm in size. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T1c."

The T stage is therefore T1c, as T1 is further divided into T1a (up to 0.5 cm), T1b (more than 0.5 cm but not more than 1 cm), and T1c (more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm)."
