This corresponds to a T2 stage. The presence of multiple masses does not affect the T stage, as it is determined by the size of the largest tumor. The T stage is also not affected by the presence of metastasis in lymph nodes or the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
