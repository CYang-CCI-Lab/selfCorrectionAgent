The type of carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, also follows the same rules for T staging as invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2."
