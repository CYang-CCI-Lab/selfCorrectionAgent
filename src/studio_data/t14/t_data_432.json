The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

T2 stages have tumors that are greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm in size. The other T stage categories are T1 (tumors up to 2 cm), T3 (tumors greater than 5 cm), and T4 (tumors of any size that invade the chest wall or skin). Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
