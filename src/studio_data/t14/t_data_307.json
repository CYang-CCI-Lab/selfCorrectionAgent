The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
