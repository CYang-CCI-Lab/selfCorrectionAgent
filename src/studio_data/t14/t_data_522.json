Using the rules provided, we can determine the T stage by measuring the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor. In this case, the largest tumor size is 4.3 cm, which falls under T2 (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 4.3 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a tumor size of 2.0 to 5.0 cm corresponds to a T2 stage."
