This is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage according to the rules provided. The presence of DCIS does not affect the T stage for invasive carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The tumor size is explicitly provided in the report, so there is no need to use any other rules to determine the T stage."
