This tumor size falls within the T2 category, which includes tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, the right breast has an infiltrating ductal carcinoma that forms a 2.1 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm mass, which falls under the T2 category (tumor size 2.0-5.0 cm). The left breast has ductal carcinoma in situ, which is non-invasive and not considered in T staging. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
