According to the rules provided, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and since this tumor is 3.3 cm, it does not meet the criteria for a T3 tumor. The report does not indicate any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is not a T4 tumor. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

Breast, Left, and Axillary Contents, Modified Radical Mastectomy). According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor size of 2.1 to 5.0 cm.
