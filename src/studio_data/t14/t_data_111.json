In this report, the size of the tumor is described as 'Invasive lobular carcinoma, 3.8 cm in greatest dimension grossly'. This means that the tumor is 3.8 centimeters in size, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The T2 stage is used for tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
