The report also specifies the tumor classification as pT2 (maximum diameter 2.5 cm), further supporting the T2 stage. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T stage of T2 corresponds to a tumor size between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
