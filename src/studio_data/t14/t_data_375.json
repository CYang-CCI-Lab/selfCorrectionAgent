The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2."
