In the TNM staging system for breast cancer, the T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. T1 is for tumors less than or equal to 2 cm in size, T2 is for tumors greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm, T3 is for tumors greater than 5 cm, and T4 is for tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Based on the given report, the tumor size is 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm, which falls in the T2 category (greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
