The type of carcinoma is invasive lobular, but the T stage is still determined by the size of the largest tumor, which is 2.5 cm in this case. The presence of metastatic lymph nodes, extracapsular invasion, or the number of lymph nodes involved does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
