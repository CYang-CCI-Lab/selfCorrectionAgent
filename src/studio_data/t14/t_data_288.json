The fact that no residual tumor was found in the mastectomy specimen does not change the T stage, as the T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor before any treatment. The presence of vascular invasion and metastasis to 4 out of 7 lymph nodes (as indicated in the report) would influence the N stage, but not the T stage."
