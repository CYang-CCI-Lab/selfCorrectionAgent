The largest dimension of this tumor is 1.6 cm, which falls within the T1 category. Furthermore, the report states 'pTNM: pT1c, NO(sn), MX', which confirms the tumor stage as T1c."

                "text": "The tumor size from the pathologic report is 1.6 cm, which falls under the T1 category. However, since the tumor has a total extent of 2.8 cm (including the non-mass like enhancement), it is classified as T1c. This is because T1 is further divided into T1a (up to 0.5 cm), T1b (more than 0.5 cm but not more than 1 cm), and T1c (more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm). In this case, the tumor size is 1.6 cm, which is more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm, so the T stage is T1c."
