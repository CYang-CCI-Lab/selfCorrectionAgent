This is more than the 5 cm threshold for T3 tumors (T3 tumors are more than 5 cm). Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T3. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma."

According to the TNM staging system, a T3 stage is assigned when the tumor is greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
