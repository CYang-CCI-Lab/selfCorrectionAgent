The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. Therefore, the greatest dimension of this tumor is 6.6 cm, which falls in the T3 category (tumor size > 5 cm). The report also mentions that the tumor is placed 0.1 cm from the base of the surgical specimen, but this does not affect the T stage determination based on tumor size."
