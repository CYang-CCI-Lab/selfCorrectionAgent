However, since it is specifically mentioned as T1c(m), we can assume that the 'c' indicates that the tumor is extending into the dermis, making it T1c. The 'm' indicates that there is multifocal disease, but as per the rules provided, this does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."

This falls within the T1 category, which includes tumors that are 2.0 cm or less in size. The 'c' subcategory is used when the tumor is larger than 1.0 cm but not larger than 2.0 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."
