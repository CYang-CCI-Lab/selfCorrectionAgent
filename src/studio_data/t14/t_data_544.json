In this report, the primary tumor is described as forming multiple (2) masses, with the largest one being 2.6 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm. This meets the criteria for a T2 stage, which is defined as a tumor size of 2.0-5.0 cm. The report also mentions that the tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. There is no information suggesting that the tumor meets the criteria for T3 or T4 stages, so the T stage is T2."
