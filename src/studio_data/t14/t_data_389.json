                "text": "The report indicates that the invasive carcinoma is located in all four quadrants of the breast, and it involves the nipple and the skin by direct extension into the dermis. These findings suggest that the tumor meets the criteria for a T4 stage cancer, which is defined as a tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The size of the tumor is not the determining factor for this stage, so the exact measurement of 10 cm mentioned in the report is not relevant for the T stage prediction. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component also does not affect the T stage, so the fact that the DCIS constitutes less than or equal to 25% of the total tumor mass is not relevant for the T stage prediction. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."

In this report, the tumor measures at least 10 cm in largest dimension (pT3) and has invaded the nipple, dermis, and skeletal muscle (pT4). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."
