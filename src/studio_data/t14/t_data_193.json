This is the invasive component of the tumor, and its maximum dimension is 3 cm. Based on the rules provided, a T3 tumor is more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is 3 cm, it falls under the T2 category, which includes tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm."

                "text": "The report indicates the presence of a lesion in the lower inner quadrant of the breast that measures 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm (T2) and is closely abutting the inked resection margin. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, and in this case, the size is within the T2 range (2.0 to 5.0 cm). The presence of vascular invasion, DCIS, and the involvement of large lactiferous ducts do not affect the T stage. The absence of skin involvement and negative surgical margins also support the T2 stage."
