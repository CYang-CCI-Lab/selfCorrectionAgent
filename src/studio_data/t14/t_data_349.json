This falls in the T2 category, which includes tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the invasive mammary carcinoma forms a 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm mass. This meets the criteria for a T2 stage tumor (T2: tumor size >2 cm but \u22645 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
