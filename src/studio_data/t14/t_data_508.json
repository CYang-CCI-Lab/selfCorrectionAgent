The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis, so the T stage remains T2."
