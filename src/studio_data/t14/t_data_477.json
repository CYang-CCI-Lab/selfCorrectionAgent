The presence of multifocal tumors and intraductal components does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor focus, and in this case, it is not relevant that there are multiple foci or that some are only microscopically visible. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
