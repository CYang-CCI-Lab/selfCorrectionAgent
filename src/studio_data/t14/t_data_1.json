This falls within the range for a T2 tumor, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, this would correspond to a T2 stage. The T1 stage is for tumors 2 cm or less, while T2 is for tumors greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm. The report also mentions a '0.9 cm focus of duct carcinoma in situ of the micropapillary and comedocarcinoma types,' but this is not included in the T stage as it is not an invasive tumor."
