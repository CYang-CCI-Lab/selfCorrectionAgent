The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The TNM classification system defines T2 as 'Tumor size > 2 cm but \u2264 5 cm.' The dorsal resection margin being tumor-free is a good prognostic factor but does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
