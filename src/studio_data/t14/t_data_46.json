The histological type is highly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, which follows the same rules as NOS for staging based on the largest tumor size. The presence of focal intraductal components and the tumor classification NOS, GI, pT2NOLOVORX do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 designation is given when the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
