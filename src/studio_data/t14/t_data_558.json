In this pathology report, the size of the invasive component of the tumor is measured to be 40 mm (4 cm) in maximum gross dimension. According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage is given to tumors that are larger than 20 mm but no larger than 50 mm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
