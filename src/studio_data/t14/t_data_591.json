The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, the tumor is described as 'pT2', which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size but not more than 5 cm. The specific measurement of the tumor size is not provided in the report, but based on the 'pT2' classification, the T stage would be T2."
