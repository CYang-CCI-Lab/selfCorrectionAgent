Based on the rules provided, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report does not indicate direct extension to the chest wall or skin, and the largest tumor size is 2.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2."
