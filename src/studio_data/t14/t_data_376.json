In this pathology report, the diagnosis states 'moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with discrete intraductal spread (tumor diameter 1.9 cm)'. The tumor size is 1.9 cm, which falls under T1 classification. T1 is further divided into T1a (tumor size \u2264 0.5 cm), T1b (tumor size > 0.5 cm but \u2264 1 cm), T1c (tumor size > 1 cm but \u2264 2 cm). Based on the report, the T stage is T1c."
