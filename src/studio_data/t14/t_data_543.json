In this report, the primary tumor is described as an 'infiltrating ductal carcinoma' that 'measures 2.8 CM in maximum dimension'. This corresponds to a T2 stage, as T1 is up to 2 cm, T2 is 2-5 cm, T3 is more than 5 cm, and T4 involves the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
