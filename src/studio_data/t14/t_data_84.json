Additionally, metastatic carcinoma is present in 25 out of 27 axillary lymph nodes. Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T3 (T3: tumor size >5 cm). The report also mentions that the tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the superior surgical margin, but this does not affect the T stage, as it only considers the size of the primary tumor."
