According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the largest tumor mass is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."
