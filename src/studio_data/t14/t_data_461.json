The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The T1 category is for tumors that are 2 cm or less, and T3 and T4 describe larger or more invasive tumors. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the patient's T stage would be T2."
