The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 designation is given for tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
