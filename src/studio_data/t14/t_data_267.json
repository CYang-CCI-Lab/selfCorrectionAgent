Additionally, there is a satellite lesion that is 0.7 cm in size, located 2 cm superior to the index mass. However, for T staging, only the size of the largest tumor is considered. The report also mentions that the tumor is an invasive ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, ignoring any substaging information. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."

According to the 7th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual, a T1 tumor is any tumor that is 2 cm or less in size, and T1c is used when the tumor is more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in size with extensive intraductal component (EIC). However, in this case, the report does not mention anything about EIC. Therefore, based only on the size of the tumor, the T stage would be T1c."
