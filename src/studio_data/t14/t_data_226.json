In this report, the largest tumor is found in the right breast, which measures approximately 6 cm. According to the rules provided, a tumor of this size would be classified as T3 (more than 5 cm). Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T3."

In the left breast, the tumor measures maximally 5 x 5 x 3 mm, which would correspond to a T1 stage. However, the T stage is based on the larger tumor, so the T stage for this patient is T3."
