The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which is 2.5 cm in this case. Following the rules provided, a tumor of this size falls under T2 (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

In the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is more than 2 cm in size but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
