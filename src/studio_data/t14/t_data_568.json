Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

This means that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 3 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in greatest dimension and less than or equal to 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
