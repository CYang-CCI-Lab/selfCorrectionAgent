The report does not provide a tumor size, but it also does not indicate T3 or T4. Based on the rules provided, if the report does not provide a tumor size, and there is no indication of T3 or T4, the T stage is most likely T2 for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2."

In this report, there is no information provided regarding the size of the tumor. However, infiltrating lobular carcinoma is typically classified as T2 if the tumor is >2 cm in greatest dimension and T1 if \u22642 cm. Since the tumor is described as infiltrating lobular carcinoma grade II and there are no other features mentioned that would modify the T stage, it is most likely that the tumor is >2 cm and therefore should be classified as T2."
