The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is determined by the size of the largest invasive tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The fact that there are two tumor masses does not change the T stage, as the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. The closest margin is 1.5 cm from the largest tumor, which also supports the T2 classification. The T2 category can be further divided into T2a (tumor size > 2 cm and \u2264 3 cm), T2b (tumor size > 3 cm and \u2264 5 cm), but the report does not provide enough information to make this distinction."
