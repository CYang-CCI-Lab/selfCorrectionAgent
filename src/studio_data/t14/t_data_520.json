This measurement is greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage according to the rules provided. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this case, the greatest dimension is 2.8 cm, which falls into the T2 category (T2: tumor size > 2 cm and \u2264 5 cm). Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
