The type of carcinoma is invasive ductal carcinoma, which follows the same rules as stated in the list for T staging. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
