The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 4.5 cm. This falls within the range for T2 tumors (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm), so the predicted T stage is T2."

                "text": "The report describes a 'lobulated red-tan glistening mass' in the right breast with a greatest dimension of 4.5 cm. This is consistent with a T2 stage tumor, which is defined as a tumor with a greatest dimension between 2.1 and 5 cm. The fact that there are two separate tumors (one measuring 4.5 cm and the other measuring 1 cm) does not change the T stage, as the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. The report also notes that the nipple and deep margin are free of neoplasm, and lymphatic invasion is not identified. There is no information in the report about invasion of the chest wall or skin, which would be required for a T3 or T4 stage designation."
