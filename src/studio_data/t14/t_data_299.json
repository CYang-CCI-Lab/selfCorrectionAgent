The T stage for cancer is based on the size of the tumor, and in this case, since both foci are 1.5 cm or less, the T stage would be T1. Specifically, it would be T1c as the total tumor size is more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm. However, the exact T stage should be confirmed by the treating physician as they have access to all the patient's information."
