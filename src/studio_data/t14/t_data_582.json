The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is used to determine the T stage, which in this case is 4.1 cm. Therefore, the T stage is T2."
