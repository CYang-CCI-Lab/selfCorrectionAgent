LEFT BREAST, MASTECTOMY diagnosis). The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 6 cm. This exceeds the size limit for T1 (2 cm or less) and T2 (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm), and is therefore T3 (more than 5 cm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."
