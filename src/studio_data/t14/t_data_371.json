The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension of the tumor is 5 cm, which falls under T2 (T2: 2.1 to 5 cm). Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
