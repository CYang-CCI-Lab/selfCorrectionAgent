The tumor is also described as poorly differentiated invasive solid carcinoma, consistent with ductal breast carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of DCIS or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

                "text": "The maximum reconstructed tumor diameter is 3.0 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (>2.0 to \u22645.0 cm). The report also mentions that the tumor forms a ventral margin with caudal distance 0.5 cm, lateral 1 cm, cranial 1.2 cm, medial and dorsal 1.5 cm, indicating that the tumor has invaded beyond the boundary of the breast ducts or lobules. However, since the report does not provide information about invasion into the skin or chest wall, we can only determine the T stage and not any substaging information. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
