Based on the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The tumor size of 3.8 cm falls within this range, so the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The other findings such as moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, focal intraductal components, and focal angioinvasion do not affect the T stage in this context. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
