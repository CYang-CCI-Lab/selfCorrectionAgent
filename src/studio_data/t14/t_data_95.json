This meets the criteria for a T2 stage tumor. The report also mentions that the tumor is pT2, confirming this assessment. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma."

                "text": "The tumor size is reported as 2.2 cm, which puts it in the T2 category (T1 is 2 cm or less). The report also mentions that the minimal width of the caudal and dorsal safety margin is 0.7-0.8 cm, which supports the T2 staging. The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor, and in this case, the size is the key factor in determining the T stage."
