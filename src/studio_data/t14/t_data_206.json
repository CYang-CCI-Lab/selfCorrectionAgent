The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2."

The tumor is located within 1 cm from the lateral margin, 1.2 cm from the anterior margin, 2.2 cm from the medial margin, 1.7 cm from the deep margin, and 1.7 cm from the inferior margin. Therefore, the T stage is T2 (tumor size \u2265 3 cm and \u2264 5 cm)."
