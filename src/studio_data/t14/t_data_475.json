The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma.

The greatest dimension of the tumor is 3.0 cm, which falls in the T2 category (tumor size 2.1 to 5.0 cm) according to the TNM staging system for cancer.
