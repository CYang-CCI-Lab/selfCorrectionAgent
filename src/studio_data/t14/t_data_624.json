The T stage is given as 2, and there is no indication of T3 or T4. The N and M stages are both 0. Following the rules provided, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report explicitly states that the T stage is 2. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report specifies that this is a radical mastectomy and the grade is 2, it can be inferred that the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage."
