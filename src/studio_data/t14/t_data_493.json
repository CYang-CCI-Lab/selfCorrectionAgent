This is based on the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor, which measures 1.5 cm. The T stage categories are as follows: T1 (tumor is 2 cm or smaller), T2 (tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm), T3 (tumor is more than 5 cm), and T4 (tumor of any size grows into the chest wall or skin). In this case, the tumor size falls within the T1 category."
