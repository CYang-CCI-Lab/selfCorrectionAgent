The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor is the 2.2 cm invasive lobular carcinoma in the left breast. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, the left breast has an invasive lobular carcinoma that measures 2.2 cm (specimen B) and the right breast has an invasive ductal carcinoma that measures 3.3 cm (specimen E). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2, as it is between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm in size."
