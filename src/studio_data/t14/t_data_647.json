However, the report does not provide a specific tumor size. Based on the rules provided, if the report does not provide a tumor size and there is no indication of T3 or T4, the T stage is most likely T2 for invasive lobular carcinoma. Although the type of carcinoma in this case is ductal rather than lobular, the same rule applies. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as one that measures between 2-5 cm in its greatest dimension. The report states that the tumor extends to within 0.1mm of the surgical margin, but it does not provide information on the size of the tumor. However, the fact that it required surgical excision suggests that it is likely to be larger than 2 cm, making the most likely T stage T2."
