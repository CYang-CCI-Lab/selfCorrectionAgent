The T stage is given as 2, and there is no indication of T3 or T4. The N and M stages are both 0. Following the rules provided, since a specific T stage is given and there is no information suggesting a different stage, the T stage for this patient is T2."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that is greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. According to the pathology report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is a type of invasive breast cancer. The report also specifies that the tumor size is not available (T stage: 2, N stage: 0, M stage: 0), but the patient underwent a radical mastectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the entire breast, including the cancerous tumor. Therefore, it can be inferred that the tumor was greater than 2 cm in size, but not greater than 5 cm in size, as a more extensive surgical procedure would have been performed if the tumor was larger than 5 cm. The grade of the tumor (grade 3) refers to the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells and does not affect the T stage."
