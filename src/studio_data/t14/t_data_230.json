Based on the rules provided, a tumor of this size would be classified as T2 (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the left breast, mastectomy specimen contains a spiculated, firm, tan mass measuring 2.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. This mass is 2.0 cm from the deep margin, 5.5 cm from the superior margin, >6 cm from the inferior margin, 2.8 cm from the lateral margin, and >6 cm from the medial margin. Therefore, the tumor size is 2.4 cm, which falls under T2 stage (Tumor size > 2 cm and < 5 cm)."
