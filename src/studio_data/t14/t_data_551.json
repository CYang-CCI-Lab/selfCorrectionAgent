The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, it is mentioned that the size of the infiltrating ductal carcinoma is 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a tumor size of greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is classified as T2. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
