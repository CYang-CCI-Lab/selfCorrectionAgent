This meets the criteria for a T2 tumor, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

The presence of lymphovascular space involvement and metastatic carcinoma in 8 out of 13 lymph nodes also supports the T2 stage, but those are used for N and M staging, not T staging."
