The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, so the T stage is still T2."
