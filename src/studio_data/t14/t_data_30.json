According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size. Since the tumor size is less than 2 cm, the T stage is T1. Furthermore, the report specifies that the tumor is T1c, which corresponds to a tumor size of 1.1 to 2 cm. However, the report also states that the tumor measures 1.5 cm in largest dimension, which falls within the T1c range. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T1c."

In this report, the maximum dimension of the tumor is 15 mm (1.5 cm), which falls within the range for T1c (1-2 cm). The subclassification of T1 into T1a, T1b, and T1c is based on tumor size, with T1c being the largest of the three subcategories. This is stated in the report as 'B. THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.5 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION'."
