Since the larger tumor size is 2.2 cm, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2, according to the rules provided. This assessment is based on the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma or the presence of other conditions such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)."

According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), T stage for invasive breast cancer is determined by the size of the largest focus.
