In this report, the right breast has a single focus of invasive lobular carcinoma with a greatest dimension of slightly >0.5 cm, which would correspond to a T1 stage. However, the left breast has a main mass lesion of 3.2 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T2 stage. Therefore, the overall T stage for this patient is T2, as it is determined by the largest tumor size."
