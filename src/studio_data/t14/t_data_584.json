                "text": "The T stage for cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue. In this pathology report, the primary tumor in the right breast is described as an 'invasive high-grade sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma' that measures 95 mm in diameter. This size is greater than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage according to the TNM staging system for cancer. The report also notes that the tumor is widely free of invasive carcinoma at the resection margins and that there is no invasive carcinoma present in the 22 axillary lymph nodes that were examined. Therefore, the T stage for this cancer is T3."
