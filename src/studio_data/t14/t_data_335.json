However, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, not the size of the specimen. The report also mentions that there is 'invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, histologic type: ductal'. The largest tumor size is not explicitly stated, but since it is less than 2 cm (the cutoff for T2), the T stage is most likely T1. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T1."

According to the TNM staging system for breast cancer, T1 stage is defined as a tumor size of 2 cm or less. Therefore, based on the size provided in the report, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
