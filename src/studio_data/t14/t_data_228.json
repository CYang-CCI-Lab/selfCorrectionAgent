Therefore, the T stage is T2, as T1 is for tumors up to 2 cm in size, T2 is for tumors between 2-5 cm, T3 is for tumors larger than 5 cm, and T4 is for tumors of any size with direct extension into the chest wall or skin. The Nottingham grade, receptor status, and lymph node involvement provided in the report are not used to determine the T stage."
