The T stage is reported as T4, which means the tumor is of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report does not provide the tumor size, but the T4 stage indicates that the tumor has extended to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T4."

In this pathology report, the T stage is reported as 4, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the chest wall or skin. The report also mentions that the patient is diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma and underwent surgery, which supports the T4 stage. The other information in the report, such as the patient's sex, grade, and normal sample, do not impact the T stage determination."
