Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor and in this case, the tumor is 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The T stage does not include any information about substaging such as tumor extension to the chest wall or skin, which is why I have ignored that information in my prediction."
