The tumor has been identified as a poorly differentiated invasive lobular carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, ignoring any substaging information. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 designation is given to tumors that are larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the patient's cancer has a pathologic T stage of T2."
