The tumor is classified as a poorly differentiated lobular carcinoma, which follows the same rules as invasive ductal carcinoma for staging purposes. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so despite the presence of lymph node involvement and other findings, the T stage is T2 based on the size provided."

The other findings in the report (focal slight intraductal spread, invasion of lymph vessels, and lobular carcinoma, G III) do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
