Specifically, T1 tumors are those that measure 2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension. The presence of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, fibrocystic changes, calcifications, and biopsy site changes do not affect the T stage. Additionally, the absence of angiolymphatic invasion supports the T1 classification. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
