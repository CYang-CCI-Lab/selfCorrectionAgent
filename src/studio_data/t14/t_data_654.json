The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 2.2 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 tumor is a tumor that is greater than 2 cm in greatest dimension and less than or equal to 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
