According to the rules, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the invasive tumor measures 2.5 cm (the largest dimension), the T stage is T2."

In this case, the greatest dimension is 2.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category (tumor size 2.0-5.0 cm). Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
