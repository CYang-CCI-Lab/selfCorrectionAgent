According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the tumor in this report falls under the T1 category. Furthermore, the 'pT 1c N 0' notation in the synoptic report also indicates that the tumor is T1c, which means it is between 1.1 and 2 cm in size."

In this report, the left breast invasive ductal carcinoma measures 1.7 cm in greatest dimension (specimen C). According to the TNM staging system, a T1 stage is further divided into T1a (0.6 cm or less), T1b (more than 0.6 cm but not more than 1 cm), T1c (more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."
