However, the right breast has a much larger tumor size of 12.5 x 6.3 x 2.2 cm, which corresponds to a T3 tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3, as it is based on the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma."

In this report, the left breast shows an infiltrating lobular carcinoma that forms a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm mass (T1). However, the right breast has a much larger infiltrating lobular carcinoma, forming a 12.5 x 6.3 x 2.2 cm mass, which involves multiple quadrants (T3). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."
