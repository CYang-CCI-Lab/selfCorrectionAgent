The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T3 stage indicates a tumor that is larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension but not more than 10 cm.
