Following the rules provided, a T3 stage would only apply if the tumor is more than 5 cm, which is not the case here. The report also mentions that the tumor is present at the anterior margin, but this does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

Additionally, the report mentions that invasive carcinoma is present in 6 of 11 slices of a 12.5 cm specimen, suggesting that the tumor may span up to 6 cm. However, the final T stage is determined by the largest contiguous focus of invasive carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2, as the largest focus of invasive carcinoma measures at least 3.5 cm."
