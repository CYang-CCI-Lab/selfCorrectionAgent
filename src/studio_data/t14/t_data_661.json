According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

The tumor is also described as being less than 1 mm from the deep margin and at least extremely close to the lateral margin, but there is no information suggesting that it has extended through the wall of the breast or into the chest wall, which would be required for a T3 or T4 stage. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
