The histological type is infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma, but the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."
