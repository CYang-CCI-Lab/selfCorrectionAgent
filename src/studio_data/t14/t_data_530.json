The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, the left breast shows an invasive lobular carcinoma with the largest tumor measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension in the upper outer quadrant, and additional foci in the retroareolar area and lower outer quadrant up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
