The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the size of the infiltrating ductal carcinoma is 2.4 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a tumor size of greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is classified as T2. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
