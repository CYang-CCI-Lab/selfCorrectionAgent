In this case, the largest dimension is 3.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category of being more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 designation is given to tumors that are greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
