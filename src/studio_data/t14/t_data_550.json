Using the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The tumor size in this report is 2.3 cm, which falls in the T2 category. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

In T stage classification, T1 is up to 2 cm, T2 is between 2-5 cm, T3 is more than 5 cm, and T4 includes tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size in this report is 2.3 cm, which is greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, the T stage would be T2."
