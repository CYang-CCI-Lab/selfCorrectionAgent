This is the only information needed to determine the T stage, as it is based solely on the size of the largest tumor. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is also not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis."

According to the TNM staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
