Based on the rules provided, a tumor of this size would be classified as T3 (more than 5 cm). This is consistent with the pathologic staging provided in the report (pT3). The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ and negative lymphovascular invasion do not affect the T stage. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."
