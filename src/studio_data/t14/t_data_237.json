Since the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor size mentioned is 3.0 cm, the T stage would be T2 (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). This is consistent with the AJCC stage provided in the report (T2N2MX)."

The T stage for invasive breast cancer is based on the size of the largest tumor found. In this case, the largest tumor is 2.0 cm, which falls under T2 (Tumor size 2.0 to 5.0 cm) category. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
