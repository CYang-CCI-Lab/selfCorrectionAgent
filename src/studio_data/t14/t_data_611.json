The T stage is given as 2, which is a valid T stage according to the rules provided. This T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the report does not indicate a tumor size greater than 5 cm or direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that is greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report specifies a T stage of 2, it can be inferred that the tumor size falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor."
