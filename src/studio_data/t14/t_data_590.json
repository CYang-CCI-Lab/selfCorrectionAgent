COMBINED; SEE DESCRIPTION.' This meets the criteria for a T3 tumor, which is 'T3 tumors are more than 5 cm.' The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular)."

In this report, the tumor size is given as 'maximum invasive tumor size: approximately 4.5 cm, gross plus microscopic data combined'. This is larger than the 2 cm cutoff for T2 stage, and therefore the T stage is T3."
