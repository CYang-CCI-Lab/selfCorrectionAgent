In this pathology report, it is stated that the size of the tumor is 5.7 x 4.8 x 2.1 cm. Additionally, it is stated that the tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor, so in this case, the T stage would be T3 (T3: tumor >5 cm in greatest dimension)."
