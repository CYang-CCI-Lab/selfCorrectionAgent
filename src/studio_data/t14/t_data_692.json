However, the report also specifies that the tumor has direct extension to the chest wall (pT4b). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."

In this report, the tumor size is 6.2 x 4.3 x 7.8 cm, which is larger than the threshold for T3 (5 cm). Additionally, the report states that there is infiltration of the carcinoma into the skin (cutis) and the chest wall muscle (musculi pectoralis), which are both indicators of T4 stage. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T4."
