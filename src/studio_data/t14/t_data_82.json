Right breast lumpectomy (short stitch superior, long lateral ) fresh: - Invasive poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3 (3 + 3 + 3), 3.5 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2, as T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor and ranges from T1 (tumor \u2264 2 cm in greatest dimension) to T4 (tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin). In this case, the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm, which corresponds to T2."
