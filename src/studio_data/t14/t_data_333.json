However, the rules also state that for invasive ductal carcinoma, the T stage is based on the largest tumor size, ignoring any substaging information. Therefore, since the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm, the T stage would be T3."

In this report, the tumor measures a maximum of 3.4 cm, which puts it in the T3 category (T3: tumor size > 5 cm). The report also mentions 'carcinomatous lymphangitis,' which is the spread of cancer to the lymphatic vessels, but it does not specify invasion of the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage is T3."
