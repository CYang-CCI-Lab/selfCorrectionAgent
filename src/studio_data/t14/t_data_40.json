The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis."

                "text": "The T stage of cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue. In this report, the tumor size is described as 4.3 x 6.2 x 2.2 cm. The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. Therefore, the greatest dimension of this tumor is 6.2 cm, which falls in the T3 category (tumor size > 5 cm). The other findings in the report, such as the presence of skin retraction and infiltration of the cancer into the skin and lymph nodes, support the T3 stage assignment. It is important to note that the T stage may be modified based on other factors, such as the presence of lymphovascular invasion or the involvement of the chest wall or skin, but this information is not provided in the report."
