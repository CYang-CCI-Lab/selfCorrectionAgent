This indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The presence of lymphovascular invasion and the specific measurement of the tumor size also support this classification. The N stage and M stage would be determined by the involvement of lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastasis, respectively, but this information is not provided in the report."
