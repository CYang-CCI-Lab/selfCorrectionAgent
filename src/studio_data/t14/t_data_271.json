                "text": "The report indicates that the largest tumor size in the right breast is 2.4 cm, which falls within the size range for a T2 tumor (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2 for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is also T2 for invasive lobular carcinoma, following the same rules as invasive ductal carcinoma, based on the largest tumor size. The report does not provide information about direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is not a T4 tumor. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T2."

In this report, the size of the tumor is stated as 'a large stellate mass measuring 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm, and located in the upper inner quadrant, 2 cm from deep margin, 1.0 cm from anterior skin.' This indicates that the size of the tumor is greater than 2 cm, which falls under the T2 category. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
