The larger of these two tumors is slightly over 5 cm, which would classify it as a T3 tumor. However, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, ignoring any substaging information. Therefore, we consider the first tumor, which is 2.6 cm in its greatest dimension. This falls within the range for a T2 tumor, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

In this report, the tumor size is given as 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm for one lesion and 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm for the other lesion. The largest dimension of the tumor is 3.0 cm, which falls in the T2 category (T2: tumor >2 cm but \u22645 cm in greatest dimension). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
