According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Therefore, the tumor size of 2.5 cm falls into the T2 category."

In this report, the largest focus of invasion is over 0.1 cm and measures 2.5 cm (Tumor Size section of the report).
