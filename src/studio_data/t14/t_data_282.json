Since the largest tumor size is 9.2 cm, the T stage is T3. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, regardless of the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular). Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma."

Additionally, there is a separate nodule adjacent to the main mass with a size of 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the primary tumor, and in this case, the tumor size exceeds the limit for T2, making it a T3 stage cancer."
