The fact that the tumor is poorly differentiated, has extensive lymphovascular invasion, and is positive for CK7 and negative for CK20 and GCPFD supports this diagnosis. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage, and the T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
