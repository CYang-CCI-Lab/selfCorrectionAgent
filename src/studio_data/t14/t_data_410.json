This is the key piece of information needed to determine the T stage. According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Since the tumor size is exactly 2 cm, the T stage would be T2."

In this report, the size of the largest focus of invasion is 2 cm, which falls in the T2 category (Tumor > 20 mm but 50 mm in greatest dimension). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
