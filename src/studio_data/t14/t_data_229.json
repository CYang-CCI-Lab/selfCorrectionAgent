This meets the criteria for a T2 tumor, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T stage of T2 corresponds to a tumor size of 2.1 to 5.0 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
