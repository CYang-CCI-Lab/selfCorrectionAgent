This is larger than the 5 cm threshold for T3 tumors, so it qualifies as a T4 tumor. The T4 stage is assigned due to the direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which is mentioned in the report as 'infiltratio carcinomatosa cutis mammae'. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T4 stage is appropriate in this case."

In this report, the tumor is described as 'Carcinoma mucinosum invasivum - NHG3' and is measured as 5.3 x 3.8 x 5.3 cm. Additionally, it is mentioned that the tumor has invaded the skin of the breast ('Infiltratio carcinomatosa cutis mammae'). Based on this information, the T stage for this patient is T4."
