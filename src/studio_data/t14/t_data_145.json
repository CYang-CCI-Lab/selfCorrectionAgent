A T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that is greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not specified, but it is classified as T2. This could be because the size of the tumor was not included in the report or it was not possible to determine the size of the tumor based on the specimen provided. However, since the report specifically states T2, we can assume that the tumor size falls within this category."
