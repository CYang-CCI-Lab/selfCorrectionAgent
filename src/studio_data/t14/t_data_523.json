This meets the criteria for a T2 tumor, which is defined as having a size of more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma, and the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is used to determine the T stage. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
