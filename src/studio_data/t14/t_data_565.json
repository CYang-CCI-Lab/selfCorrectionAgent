Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report specifies that the ILC measured 30 mm, which falls within the T2 range of more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

The T stage for cancer is based on the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less, T2 being more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 being more than 5 cm, and T4 being a tumor of any size that extends through the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the patient's cancer has a T stage of T2."
