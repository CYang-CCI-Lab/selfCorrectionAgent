This is specified in the report as 'SIZE OF TUMOR: Maximum dimension invasive component: 2.5 cm.' The T stage is defined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being \u2264 2 cm, T2 being > 2 cm but \u2264 5 cm, T3 being > 5 cm, and T4 being any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, in this case, the T stage is T2."
