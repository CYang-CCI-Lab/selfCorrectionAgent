The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor which is 2.2 cm. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is assigned to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
