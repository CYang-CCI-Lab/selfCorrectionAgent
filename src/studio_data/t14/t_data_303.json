The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report specifies that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is one of the types of breast cancer where the T stage is based on the size of the tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly mentioned, but it does state that the tumor is 'T2'. Therefore, based on the information provided, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
