In this report, the largest focus of the tumor has a diameter of 3.0 cm. Therefore, the T stage is T2, as T1 is for tumors with a size up to 2.0 cm, T2 is for tumors between 2.1 to 5.0 cm, T3 is for tumors larger than 5.0 cm, and T4 is for tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. So, the T stage from this report is T2."
