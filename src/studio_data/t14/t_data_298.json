The 'LOVORX' part of the classification indicates that the tumor involves the overlying skin (T3b) or the ribs (T3c), but since it does not specify which one, we cannot determine if it is T3b or T3c. Regardless, both are still categorized as T3. The 'LO' part of the classification indicates that the tumor is close to the lung (less than 0.1 cm), but this does not affect the T stage."
