The T stage is given as 2, which aligns with the rules provided. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report directly provides the T stage as 2. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient is T2."

According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not explicitly stated in centimeters. However, since the report specifies a T Stage of 2, it can be inferred that the tumor size falls within the T2 range."
