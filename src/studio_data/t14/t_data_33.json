                "text": "The report provides a tumor size of 3.5 cm and indicates that the tumor has invaded the skin (pT4b). This meets the criteria for a T4 stage tumor, which is defined as being of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T4 stage is still applicable. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T4 stage is still applicable even though the histological type is not specified in the report. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T4."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and the extent of its invasion into the surrounding tissue. In this report, the tumor is described as a 3.5 cm well differentiated invasive ductal breast carcinoma with focal invasion of lymph vessels, infiltration of the skin. This meets the criteria for a T4 stage tumor, as it has invaded the skin. The specific sub-stage of T4b is also provided in the report, which indicates that the tumor has infiltrated the skin and/or chest wall and may also include ulceration and/or satellite nodules."
