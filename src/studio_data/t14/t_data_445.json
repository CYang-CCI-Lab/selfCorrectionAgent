However, it also mentions that the tumor extends under the skin (skin is involved), which qualifies it as T4 based on the rules provided. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T4."

This is confirmed by the gross description and the tumor extent noted in the report. The specific sub-stage (T4a, T4b, or T4c) cannot be determined without additional information."
