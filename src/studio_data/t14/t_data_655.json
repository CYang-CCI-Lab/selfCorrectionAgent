In this pathology report, it is mentioned that the patient has an invasive ductal breast carcinoma with a size of 3.5 cm. The T stage is determined by the following size ranges: T1 (<= 2 cm), T2 (> 2 cm and <= 5 cm), T3 (> 5 cm), and T4 (tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin). Based on the given information, the patient's T stage is T2 (> 2 cm and <= 5 cm), as the tumor size is 3.5 cm."
