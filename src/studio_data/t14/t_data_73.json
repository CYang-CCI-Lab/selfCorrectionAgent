The T stage is reported as 2, which is a valid T stage according to the rules provided. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the report specifies a T stage of 2, so that is the predicted T stage. The N and M stages are both 0, indicating no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis."

                "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size but not larger than 5 cm. According to the pathology report, the tumor size is not specified in centimeters, but it is mentioned that the patient underwent a radical mastectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the whole breast. This suggests that the tumor was large enough to require such a procedure. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage for this patient is most likely T2."
