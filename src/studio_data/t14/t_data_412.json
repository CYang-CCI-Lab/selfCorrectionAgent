The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T3 stage still applies. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T3 stage is the correct prediction for this report."

According to the TNM staging system, a T3 stage is assigned to tumors that are greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
