Based on the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 3.5 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2.0 to 5.0 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
