In this report, the size of the invasive component of the tumor is stated as having the greatest dimension of 2.4 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 designation is given to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
