However, the report also mentions 'extensive skin proliferation' and 'minor ulceration in the skin', as well as 'focal tumor pattern along the incision line at the side of the base and lower boundary'. These findings suggest that the tumor has extended to the chest wall or skin, which upstages it to a T4 tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."

In this report, the tumor is described as being 7 x 4 x 8 cm, which is larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension, and it has invaded the skin, as indicated by the finding of 'extensive skin proliferation' and 'minor ulceration in the skin' that were confirmed microscopically. Therefore, the T stage for this cancer is T4."
