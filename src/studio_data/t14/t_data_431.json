According to the TNM staging system for cancer, T1 tumors are 2.0 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5.0 cm, and T4 tumors involve the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the tumor size in this report (2.2 x 2.4 x 2.4 cm) falls within the T2 category, which is for tumors that are more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm in size."
