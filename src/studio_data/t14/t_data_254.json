This puts the tumor size in the T2 category, which includes tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T2 stage still applies even though the histological type is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. The T stage is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, so the T2 stage is still applicable here."

                "text": "The T stage for cancer is based on the size of the tumor. In this report, the tumor size is described as 'Greatest dimension (pT2) : Not less than 2.5 cm, and possibly as much as 4.0 cm'. This indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The fact that the tumor extends into the surrounding fat and is present at the medial and posterior margins supports this staging. The absence of vessel invasion and calcification also support this staging. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
