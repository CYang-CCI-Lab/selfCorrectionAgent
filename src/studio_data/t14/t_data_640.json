The largest tumor size is given as 2.0 cm and 2.4 cm, with a sum of 4.4 cm. However, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 2.4 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

In this report, the primary tumor is described as having an invasive component with a greatest dimension of 4.4 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is assigned when the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
