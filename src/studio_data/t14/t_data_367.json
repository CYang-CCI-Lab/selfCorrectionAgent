The tumor size in this report falls within this range, so the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 4 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2-5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
