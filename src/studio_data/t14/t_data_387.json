The histological type of invasive lobular carcinoma also follows the same rules as invasive ductal carcinoma, based on the largest tumor size. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
