The tumor type is poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, ignoring any substaging information. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

In this pathology report, the diagnosis states 'tumor diameter 2.8 cm' which indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size. According to the TNM staging system, a tumor size of 2.1 to 5.0 cm corresponds to a T2 stage. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
