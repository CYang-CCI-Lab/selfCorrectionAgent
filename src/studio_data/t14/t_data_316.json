This is determined by the measurement of the largest focus of invasion over 0.1 cm, which is 2 cm in this case. The T1 category is for tumors that are 2 cm or less in size. The subcategories T1a, T1b, and T1c are based on size, with T1c being the largest at more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm. The report also states that the tumor cells are negative for ER, PR, and Her2 by immunohistochemistry, and that the margins are free of tumor. Additionally, there is no lymphovascular invasion identified and no skin present."
