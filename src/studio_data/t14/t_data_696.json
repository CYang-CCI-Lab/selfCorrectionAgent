The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

In this pathology report, the tumor is described as having a diameter of 2.2 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T2 designation is given to tumors that are larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension and less than or equal to 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
