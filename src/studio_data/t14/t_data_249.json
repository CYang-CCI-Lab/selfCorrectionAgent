In this report, the largest focus of invasion of the invasive ductal carcinoma is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a T stage of T2 is assigned to a tumor that is greater than 20 mm but less than or equal to 50 mm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
