This meets the criteria for a T3 tumor, which is defined as being more than 5 cm in size. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."

In this pathology report, the right modified radical mastectomy specimen contains a mass that measures 5.5 cm in greatest dimension (D6-D14). According to the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is assigned when the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
