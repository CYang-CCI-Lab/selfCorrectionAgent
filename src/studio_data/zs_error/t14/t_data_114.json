The T stage for breast cancer is primarily based on the size of the tumor. As the tumor size is 2.0 cm, which falls in the range of 2.0 to 5.0 cm, the T stage is T2. The other findings, such as the tumor coming close to the inner lower quadrant margin, the presence of microcalcification associated with the tumor, and ductal carcinoma in situ, do not affect the T stage. The HER2/neu gene amplification status and hormone receptor status also do not impact the T stage."
