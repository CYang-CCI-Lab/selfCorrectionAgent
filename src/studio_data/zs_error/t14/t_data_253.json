As tumor size is used to determine the T stage, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage, the T stage for this patient is T1."

The T stage categories are as follows: T1 (tumor is 2 cm or less in size), T2 (tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size), T3 (tumor is more than 5 cm in size), and T4 (tumor of any size that extends through the chest wall or skin).
