In this report, the largest dimension of the invasive component in the right breast is approximately 2.0 cm, and in the left breast, it is not specified. Therefore, the T stage would be T2 (tumor size 2.0-5.0 cm) based on the size of the tumor in the right breast. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of lymphovascular invasion. The report also mentions that the resection margins are negative for carcinoma, which is a good prognostic factor."
