The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the tumor is larger than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage. This is consistent with the report's statement of 'GROSS TUMOR SIZE IS AT LEAST 6.0 CM' for the modified mastectomy specimen. The presence of lymphatic/vascular invasion, multifocal tumor, or lymph node involvement does not affect the T stage, so those factors can be ignored for this determination."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. Therefore, the T stage is T2 (tumor size > 2 cm and \u2264 5 cm) based on the size described in the biopsy specimen."
