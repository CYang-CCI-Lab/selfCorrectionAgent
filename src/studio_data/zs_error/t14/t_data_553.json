The largest tumor size in this report is 12 cm, which falls into the T3 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T3."
