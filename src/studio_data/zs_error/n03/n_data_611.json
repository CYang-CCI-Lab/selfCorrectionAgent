Specifically, N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N2mi) in 1 to 3 lymph nodes. The report does not provide information on the specific number of lymph nodes with metastases, but it does indicate that the N Stage is 2, which matches the definition of N2."

                "text": "The N stage for a cancer report is determined by the presence and extent of cancer spread to the lymph nodes. According to the given pathology report, the N stage is 2. However, the report does not provide information about the number of involved lymph nodes or the size of the metastasis, which are necessary to determine the N stage more precisely. In the absence of this information, we can only provide an approximate N stage. N1 is an appropriate approximation, as it indicates clinically apparent axillary nodal metastasis or in-transit metastasis. Please note that a more accurate N stage can be determined with additional information."
