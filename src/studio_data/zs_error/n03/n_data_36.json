This indicates that the cancer has spread to 3 axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pathologic N stage of N2. The substaging information (N1a, N1b, N1c, N2a, N2b, etc.) is not provided in the report, so we cannot make a more specific prediction. The size of the lymph nodes or the presence of extranodal extension is not mentioned in the report, so we cannot use that information to further refine the N stage."
