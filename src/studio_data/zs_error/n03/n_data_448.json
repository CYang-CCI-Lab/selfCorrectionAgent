Based on the rules provided, if no lymph nodes are examined, the N stage cannot be determined (Nx). However, since the report explicitly states that no lymph nodes were examined, it is likely that the report is following the new rule 10 or 11, which allows for the interpretation of N0 when no lymph nodes are examined. Therefore, the predicted N stage is N0."
