This indicates that metastases were found in 6 out of 35 assessed axillary lymph nodes. According to the new rule 12, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes.

This corresponds to a pathologic N stage of N2, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer. The AJCC system classifies N stage based on the number of axillary lymph nodes involved, with N0 indicating no lymph node involvement, N1 indicating 1-3 positive nodes, N2 indicating 4-9 positive nodes, and N3 indicating 10 or more positive nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."
