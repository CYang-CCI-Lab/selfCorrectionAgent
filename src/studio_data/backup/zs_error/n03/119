Specifically, the report mentions metastatic carcinoma in 3 out of 3 lymph nodes in the additional level 1 lymph node on the right axilla, and in 4 out of 4 lymph nodes in the additional right level 2 axillary contents. This information supports the prediction of N3 stage."

Additionally, there is metastatic carcinoma in 4 out of 4 additional level 2 axillary contents, with extranodal extension (pN3a). The highest N stage reported is N3a, but since there is no mention of supraclavicular or infraclavicular involvement, the final N stage is N2."
