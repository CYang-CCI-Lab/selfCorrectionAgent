This is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for cancer, where N2 is defined as 'Metastasis in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically apparent ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary metastasis, or in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and in clinically apparent ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary metastasis.' However, the report does not mention internal mammary node involvement, so we can assume that the N stage is N2 based on the axillary lymph node metastases."
