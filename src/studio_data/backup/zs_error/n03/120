          "text": "The report mentions that axillary lymph nodes were removed and described as showing 'Lymphonodulitis chronica (No I)'. This indicates that there is chronic inflammation in the lymph nodes but no metastasis (No I). However, further along in the report, it is mentioned that the 'histopathological diagnosis' includes 'pNO', which stands for 'pN0', meaning no metastasis in the lymph nodes. This information is likely to be more accurate, as it is the final diagnosis. However, there is a discrepancy between the macroscopic description and the histopathological diagnosis. To resolve this discrepancy, I would recommend reviewing the physical examination and imaging results, as well as discussing the case with the pathologist. Based on the information provided in the report alone, I would assign a pathologic N stage of N0. However, since the report mentions 'Lymphonodulitis chronica (No I)', I will choose the more conservative option and assign a pathologic N stage of N1, which assumes that there is some degree of lymph node involvement."
