This matches with the definition of N0 in New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

The term 'lymphonodulitis chronica et sinus histiocytosis lymphonodorum (No VI)' indicates the presence of chronic inflammation and histiocytosis in 6 axillary lymph nodes. However, it does not specify if any of these nodes contain metastatic cancer. Therefore, based on the information provided, the patient's N stage would be N1, which indicates metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes."
