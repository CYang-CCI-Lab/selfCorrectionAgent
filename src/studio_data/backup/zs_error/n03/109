However, based on the new rule 10 and new rule 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. In this case, the nonsentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
