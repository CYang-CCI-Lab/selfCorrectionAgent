Additionally, there is a microscopic focus of metastatic mammary carcinoma in one out of three lymph nodes (1/3) in level I of the left axilla. There are no metastases in the other assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage is N1, as per New Rule 12, which indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
