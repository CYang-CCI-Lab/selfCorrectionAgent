However, the pathology report does not provide information about the involvement of regional lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the available information, the patient's N stage would be N1, which indicates the presence of metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or in internal mammary lymph nodes with clinically negative axillary nodes."
