The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less in size, T2 being more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 being more than 5 cm, and T4 being a tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the patient's T stage is T2."
