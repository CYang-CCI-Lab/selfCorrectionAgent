This exceeds the maximum size for a T2 tumor (which is 5 cm), so the T stage must be T3 or higher. There is no indication in the report of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so the T stage is not T4. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."

In this pathology report, the primary tumor in the right breast measures approximately 8 cm in its greatest dimension (specimen D and comment section). According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage is given when the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
