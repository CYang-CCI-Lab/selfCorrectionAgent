This falls within the size range for a T1 tumor (2 cm or less). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1."

In this report, the left breast shows a firm to hard, fairly circumscribed, centrally placed mass, measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, approximately 1.0 cm from the deep margin. Therefore, the T stage for this cancer is T2 (tumor size > 2 cm and \u2264 5 cm)."
