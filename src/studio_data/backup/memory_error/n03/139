This is supported by the new rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0, based on the information provided in the report and the learned rules for predicting the N stage of cancer from pathology reports. Ignoring any substaging information, the N stage is N0, as per the four options provided in the prompt (N0, N1, N2, N3)."
