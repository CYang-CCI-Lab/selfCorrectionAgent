This falls in the T3 category, which includes tumors larger than 5 cm. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3."

In this pathology report, the left breast was removed and several masses were found in the upper outer quadrant. The largest mass measured 4 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage is T2 (tumor size 2-5 cm)."
