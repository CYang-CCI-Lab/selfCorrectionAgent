This indicates that the tumor is larger than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. The presence of metastasis in one axillary lymph node does not affect the T stage."

In this report, the pathologic diagnosis of the left breast specimen indicates that the invasive lobular carcinoma spans an area of about 4.5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2, which corresponds to a tumor size between 2.1 and 5.0 cm."
