          "text": "The report describes the size of the surgical specimen as 5 x 4 x 2 cm. The T stage for invasive breast carcinoma is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the largest dimension of the tumor is 5 cm, which falls under T2 (>2 cm but \u22645 cm). However, the report also mentions that the minimum side margin is 0.2 cm, indicating that the tumor was completely removed with a clear margin of 0.2 cm. This suggests that the tumor was smaller than 5 cm in its maximum dimension before it was excised. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1 (\u22642 cm)."
