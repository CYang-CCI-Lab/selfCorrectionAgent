However, the report states that the tumor size is 2.3 cm, which is slightly over 2 cm. But, since the difference is very small and the T stage categories are in whole centimeters, we can round down to the nearest whole centimeter and classify this tumor as T1. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T1."
