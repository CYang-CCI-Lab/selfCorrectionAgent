The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, so in this case, the T stage is T3 (more than 5 cm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis."
