This is the largest tumor focus, with a maximum dimension of 2.5 cm. Based on the rules provided, this falls under T2 tumors, which are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm."

          "text": "The T stage for cancer is determined by the size of the primary tumor. In this report, the primary tumor is described as having a largest focus of invasion measuring 3mm and a separate mass of 2.5 cm. The largest focus of invasion is smaller than the size of the separate mass. The T stage is determined by the size of the larger tumor. Therefore, the T stage is T2 (tumor size 2.0-5.0 cm) according to the TNM staging system."
