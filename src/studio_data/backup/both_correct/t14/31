According to the rules, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

In this report, the tumor is described as 'infiltrating poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, measuring 3.0 by 2.5 by 0.7 cm.' This means that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension, but not larger than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage is T2."
