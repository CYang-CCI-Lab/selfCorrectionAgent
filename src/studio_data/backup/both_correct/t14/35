The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma forms a mass that is 2.1 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm in size. This is larger than the 2 cm threshold for T2 stage, therefore the T stage is T2."
