This is smaller than the 2 cm threshold for T2 tumors, so the tumor is not a T2, T3, or T4 tumor. The report does not indicate any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so the tumor is not a T4 tumor. Therefore, the tumor is a T1 tumor. The specific T1 substage (T1a, T1b, T1c) is provided in the report as pT1c, so the T stage is T1c."
