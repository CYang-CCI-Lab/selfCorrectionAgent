The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2."
