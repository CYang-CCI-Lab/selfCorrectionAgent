This meets the criteria for a T4 tumor, which is defined as being of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T4. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage is still T4 even though the histological type is invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, so the T stage is still T4."

          "text": "The T stage for cancer is determined by the size of the primary tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures. In this report, the primary tumor is described as having a size of 7.0 cm and invading the dermis, epidermis, and nipple with ulceration. Additionally, the deep (skeletal muscle) margin is involved by the tumor. These findings support a T4 stage. The specific substage T4b is given in the report, which indicates tumor ulceration. However, for the purpose of this question, we are only asked to determine the main T stage and not the substage. Therefore, the main T stage is T4."
