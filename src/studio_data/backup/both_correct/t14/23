Using the rules provided, a T1 tumor is 2 cm or less, a T2 tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and a T3 tumor is more than 5 cm. Since the tumor size in this report is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2, as the greatest dimension of the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm (T2: 2.0 to 5.0 cm)."
