This falls within the range for T2 tumors (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular) does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

In this report, the tumor is described as having a size of 3 x 2.5 x 3.3 cm. The T stage is determined by the greatest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the greatest dimension is 3.3 cm, which falls within the T2 category (tumor size > 2 cm and <= 5 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
