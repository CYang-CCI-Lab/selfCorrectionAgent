The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Tumor size is used to determine the T stage, even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T3."
