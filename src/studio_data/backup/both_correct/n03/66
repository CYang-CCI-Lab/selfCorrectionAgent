In this pathology report, it is stated that one out of 23 lymph nodes is positive for carcinoma (1/23). This indicates that the cancer has spread to at least one lymph node, which corresponds to N1 stage. The substaging information, such as the size of the metastasis or the number of positive lymph nodes, is not provided in this report, so only the main N stage can be determined."
