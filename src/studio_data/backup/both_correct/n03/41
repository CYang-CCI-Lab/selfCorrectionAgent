This is supported by multiple rules, including Rule 2, Modified Rule 6, Rule 8, New Rule 10, and New Rule 11. The report specifies that the patient is a female with a diagnosis of breast cancer, specifically infiltrative ductal carcinoma located in the right breast. The T stage is 2, and there is no mention of metastases in the lymph nodes (N stage). The M stage is 0, indicating no distant metastasis. The treatment details are not provided, but they are not relevant to determining the N stage."
