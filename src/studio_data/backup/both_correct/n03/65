This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The absence of extracapsular invasion of the lymph nodes and the fact that the report does not mention any other additional pathologic findings that would suggest a higher N stage also support this classification. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."
