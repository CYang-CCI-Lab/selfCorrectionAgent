However, the report mentions that the tumor directly extends to the chest wall or skin in the right breast, indicating a T4 stage. Since the T stage is determined by the largest tumor size, regardless of the type of carcinoma, and tumor size is used to determine the T stage even when the histological type is Medullary Adenocarcinoma, the T stage from this report is T4."

For the left breast, the size of the tumor is given as 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, which falls in the T2 category (tumor size 2.0-5.0 cm). For the right breast, the size of the tumor is given as 1.5 cm, which also falls in the T2 category. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
