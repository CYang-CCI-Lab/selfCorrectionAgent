However, the report also mentions 'massive subepidermal carcinomatous lymphangitis of the skin spindle' which suggests direct extension to the skin (T4). But since the exact size of this involvement is not specified, we cannot definitively classify it as T4. Therefore, based on the largest tumor size, the T stage is T3."

The T3 category includes tumors that have spread to the chest wall or skin, as indicated by the presence of 'massive subepidermal carcinomatous lymphangitis of the skin spindle.' Therefore, the T stage from this report is T3."
