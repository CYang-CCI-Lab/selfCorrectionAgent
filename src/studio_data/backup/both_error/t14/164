The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which is 1.5 cm in this case. This falls within the T2 category, which includes tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

          "text": "The report mentions that there are two invasive tumor masses in the right breast, with the largest mass measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension (1.5 by 1.5 by 1.0 cm and 1.5 by 1.2 by 1.0 cm). Based on the TNM staging system, a T2 stage is assigned when the primary tumor is more than 2 cm in greatest dimension. However, since the largest mass is just under 2 cm, I am unable to use the size of the tumor to assign a T stage. Instead, I will use the extent of the tumor. The report mentions that the tumor 'closely approaches medial margin (within 0.2_cm)'. This indicates that the tumor extends to within 0.2 cm of the margin, which is indicative of a T2 stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
