ASSOCIATED MICROCALCITICATIONS (2.0 CM)' was found during the left radical modified mastectomy procedure. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 2.0 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less, T2 being more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 being more than 5 cm, and T4 being any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, the patient's T stage is T2."
