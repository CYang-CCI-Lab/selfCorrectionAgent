However, the rules state that if the report does not provide a tumor size, and there is no indication of T3 or T4, the T stage is most likely T2 for invasive lobular carcinoma. This rule can be applied to invasive ductal carcinoma as well. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2."

          "text": "The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor. A T2 stage tumor is defined as one that measures between 2 cm and 5 cm in size. In the report, it is mentioned that the distance of invasive carcinoma to the closest margin is 5mm, but there is no information about the size of the tumor. However, the presence of focal areas of necrosis and the description of the tumor as invasive ductal carcinoma suggests that the tumor is likely to be larger than 2 cm, but there is no information to suggest it is larger than 5 cm. Therefore, the most likely T stage is T2."
