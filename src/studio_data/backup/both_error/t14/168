However, since the report specifies a size greater than 2 cm, we can conclude that the T stage is T1, not T2. This is because the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest tumor is still within the T1 range (despite being larger than 2 cm) due to the specific tumor type (invasive ductal carcinoma). The presence of DCIS or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1."

The report also mentions that there are tumor-free structurally intact lymph nodes (pN0) and no distant metastasis (MX). Therefore, based on the information provided, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T1."
