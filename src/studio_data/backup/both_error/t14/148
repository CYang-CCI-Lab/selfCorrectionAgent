The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma (invasive ductal or invasive lobular). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."

T2 stage refers to a tumor that is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. The information about the positive deep margin and other pathological findings are important for overall staging and treatment planning, but the T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. Therefore, based on the given report, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
