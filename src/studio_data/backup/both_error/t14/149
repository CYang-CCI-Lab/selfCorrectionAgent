Using the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Since the largest tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

The T stage is primarily based on the size of the tumor, and in this case, the reported dimensions indicate a T2 stage. The fact that the tumor comes within 0.2 cm of the deep margin and has vascular invasion does not affect the T stage, as T staging is only based on tumor size."
