However, the report does not provide enough information to determine if there is any microscopic cancer present in the lymph nodes. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, 'N1' is the appropriate designation when 1-3 axillary lymph nodes are positive for cancer, regardless of whether the cancer is only seen under a microscope. Therefore, the N stage from this report is 'N1'."
