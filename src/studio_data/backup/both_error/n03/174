This information indicates that the N stage is at least N1a. Since there is no information suggesting that the metastases are in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases, the N stage is not higher than N1. Therefore, the N stage is N1."

The N stage is determined by the number of positive lymph nodes, and N1 corresponds to metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
