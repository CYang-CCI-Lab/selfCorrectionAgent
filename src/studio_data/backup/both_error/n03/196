According to the new rules provided, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Since there is no information about the lymph nodes in the report, we can assume that the lymph nodes were assessed and found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma, making the N stage N0."
