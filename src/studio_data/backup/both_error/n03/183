Based on the new rule 12, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. However, the report does not specify the exact number of positive lymph nodes between 1 and 3, so we can only conclude that the N stage is N1 or higher. But since the report does not provide information suggesting N2 or N3 stages, we can predict the N stage to be N1 based on the available information."

There is no information about extranodal extension or the location of the positive lymph nodes, so we cannot make any further substaging."
