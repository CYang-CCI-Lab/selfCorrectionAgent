This information corresponds to the AJCC staging system's N2 category, which indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."

This indicates that the cancer has spread to multiple (more than 4) axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pathologic N2 stage. The T2 stage is also mentioned in the report, indicating the tumor size is between 2-5 cm. The MX stage indicates that distant metastasis could not be assessed."
