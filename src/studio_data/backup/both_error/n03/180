This is explicitly stated in the report, so there is no need to infer it from other pieces of information. The report does not contain information about the specific number of positive lymph nodes, but it does provide the overall N stage, which is N1. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."

In this report, the 'N Stage' is specified as '1', indicating that cancer has been found in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or in the inframammary nodes. The report mentions 'Infiltrative ductal carcinoma' and 'T Stage: 2', which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. The 'M Stage' is '0', meaning there is no distant metastasis. Therefore, based on the information provided, the N stage is N1."
