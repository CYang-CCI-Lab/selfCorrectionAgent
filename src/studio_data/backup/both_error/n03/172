According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, N1 indicates metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or in clips from a sentinel node dissection. In this case, the patient has 4 positive nodes, but since the report does not mention any sentinel node procedure, we can assume that these are from the axillary lymph node dissection. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
