This corresponds to the N1 stage as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report specifies that 'Microscopic examination is performed. Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses. Breast carcinoma checklist: Operative procedure: mastectomy. Specimen size: 17 x 15.5 X 3.9 cm. Specimen integrity: Intact. Tumor location: Upper outer quadrant, lower outer quadrant, and sub-areolar. Tumor focality: Multifocal. Tumor size: 3.2 x 2.2x1.3 cm, with other nodules as large as 1.1 cm. Tumor extent: tumor limited to breast, without invasion of skin or muscle. Tumor type: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Histologic grade: 2/3 (score: tubules 3 + nucleus 2 + mitoses 1 = 6/9). by ESBR criteria. Mitotic index: <1/hpf (low). Lymphovascular invasion: Present. Perineural invasion: Absent. Margins of invasive carcinoma: Negative (nearest = 12 mm; location; deep). In situ carcinoma: Present; Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Extent of in situ carcinoma: Non-extensive, comprises 5% of total. carcinoma. Grade of in situ carcinoma: 1/3 by SBR criteria (low). Margins of in situ carcinoma: Negative. Paget's disease: Absent. Number of Lymph nodes examined: 18. Number of Lymph nodes positive: 2 (1/3 sentinel nodes, and 1/15 nodes from mastectomy). Size of largest metastatic focus: 6 mm. Extracapsular extension: Absent.)'."
