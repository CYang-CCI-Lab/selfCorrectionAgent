The 'pT1' indicates that the tumor size is between 0.2 cm and 2 cm, and the 'Nla(sn)' suggests that there is a metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1) and that the sentinel lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma (sn). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."

The 'a' indicates that axillary lymph node dissection has not been performed, and the '(sn)' indicates that sentinel lymph node biopsy has been performed. 'LOVORO' does not contribute to the TNM staging. Therefore, the N stage from this report is N1."
