This corresponds to a pathologic N3a stage, as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer. The N stage is determined by the number of lymph nodes involved, and in this case, all examined lymph nodes contained metastases. This indicates a high likelihood of cancer spread and a more advanced cancer stage."
