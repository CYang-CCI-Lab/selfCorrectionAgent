Specifically, N2a indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. However, the report only mentions eight positive lymph nodes, so the patient's N stage would be N2a. The report also mentions extensive extracapsular extension and deposits larger than 2 mm, which are factors that would typically upstage the N stage, but the AJCC staging system does not provide separate substaging categories for these factors in the N2a category."
