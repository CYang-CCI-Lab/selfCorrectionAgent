This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the sentinel lymph nodes, which would correspond to an N0 stage. The number of lymph nodes examined and the absence of cancer in those nodes supports this classification. The N stage is a classification of the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes and an N0 stage indicates that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes."
