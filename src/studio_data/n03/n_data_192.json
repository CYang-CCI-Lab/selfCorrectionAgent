This information aligns with New Rule 11 and Rule 8, which state that N0 indicates that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma, and if no lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, the N stage is N0. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the sentinel lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The N stage is a classification of the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes and is an important factor in cancer staging. In this case, the N stage is N0, which means no cancer was found in the lymph nodes."
