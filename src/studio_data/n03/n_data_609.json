In this pathology report, the sentinel lymph node #1 has micrometastatic carcinoma (1/1), while the other sentinel lymph nodes (#2 and #3) do not have any metastasis (0/1). The presence of micrometastasis in one out of three examined lymph nodes classifies the N stage as N1, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer."
