In this report, it is stated that one out of sixteen examined lymph nodes contains metastatic carcinoma with a largest metastasis size of 3 mm and minimal extracapsular extension. This information indicates that the patient has cancer in at least one lymph node, classifying them as N1. The substaging information, such as the number of positive lymph nodes or the size of the largest metastasis, is not necessary for determining the N stage and has been disregarded."
