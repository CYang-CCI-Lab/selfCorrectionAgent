In Part 2, the report mentions 'NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (0/1)' for the right axillary sentinel node, and in Part 3, it states 'NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (0/1)' for the left axillary sentinel node. Furthermore, Part 5 mentions 'Lymph nodes examined: 2' and 'Lymph nodes positive: 0'. According to the provided rules, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rules 10 and 11). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
