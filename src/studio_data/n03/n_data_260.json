In this pathology report, it is stated that 'ONE OF TWO SENTINEL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA' (D and E). More specifically, Sentinel Lymph Node #1 has a largest metastatic focus of 0.4 cm (Part D). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1, as there is cancer found in one to three axillary lymph nodes, and the largest metastasis is less than 3 cm."
