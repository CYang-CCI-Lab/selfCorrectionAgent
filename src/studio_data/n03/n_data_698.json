This corresponds to the N1 stage based on the AJCC staging system, as per New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total). The fact that the metastases were identified using immunohistochemistry and not on H&E does not change the N stage, as the presence of metastases is what determines the N stage."
