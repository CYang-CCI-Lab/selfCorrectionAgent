The report does not mention any other specific details about the number of lymph nodes or the presence of metastases in other locations, so we cannot apply any other N stage rules."

The 'No I/X' notation refers to the number of examined lymph nodes that contain cancer. In this case, '1' out of 'X' (an unknown number of examined lymph nodes) has cancer. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
