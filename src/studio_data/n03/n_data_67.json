Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, the N stage for a patient with cancer metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes is N1, while the N stage for a patient with cancer metastasis in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes is N2. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2. The report does not provide information about extracapsular extension, which is not required to determine the N stage in this case."
