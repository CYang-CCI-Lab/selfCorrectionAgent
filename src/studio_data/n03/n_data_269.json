This is supported by New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, Modified Rule 6 and New Rule 10 support this finding, as they both indicate that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes."
