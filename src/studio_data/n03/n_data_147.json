This indicates that there are no metastatic carcinomas found in the assessed axillary lymph nodes. According to the new rules 10 and 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the pathologic N stage for this patient is N0."
