In this report, the diagnosis is 'poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma' with a tumor diameter of 3.5 cm and focal marked intraductal patterns of spread. The concluding tumor classification is 'NOS, G III, pT2N1aLOV0RX, IGA-A8-A0S4-01A-PR.' The 'N1' stage is indicated by 'N1a' in the concluding tumor classification, which means there is metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage from this report is N1."
