This corresponds to N0 in the AJCC staging system. The new rule 11 supports this prediction, as it states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. The modified rule 6 and new rule 10 also support this prediction, as they indicate that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

The 'pNO' notation in the histopathological diagnosis also indicates that no lymph node metastases were found. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
