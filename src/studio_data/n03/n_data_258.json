The report mentions 'pN1a: Metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, at least 1 metastasis greater than 2.0 mm.' This information supports the N1 stage prediction."

Specifically, the report mentions metastatic carcinoma in two sentinel lymph nodes (1/1 for both sentinel node #1 and #2), and no other lymph nodes were examined. Therefore, the patient's N stage is N1a."
