This corresponds to N1 as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The other two sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma. The report also mentions that the lymph nodes were assessed using touch preps and immunohistochemistry, confirming the accuracy of the assessment."

                "text": "The N stage for a cancer patient is determined by the involvement of lymph nodes. In this report, the patient has one sentinel lymph node (SLN #2) with micrometastatic carcinoma (1.5 mm) out of the three sentinel lymph nodes examined. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, so the N stage is not N0 (no lymph node involvement). The report does not provide information about the number of lymph nodes with macrometastases (larger than 2.0 mm) or the presence of extranodal extension, so we cannot determine if the N stage is N2 or N3. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
