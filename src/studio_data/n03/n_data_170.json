The report also mentions that cytokeratin (AE1/3) stains confirm the negative status of the sentinel lymph nodes. Based on the rules provided, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (New Rule 10) or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rule 11). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
