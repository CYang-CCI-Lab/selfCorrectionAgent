The concluding tumor classification is NOS, G II, pT2N0LOVORO. According to the given rules, N0 indicates no positive lymph nodes or no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. The 'pT2' indicates a tumor size of 2.1-5.0 cm, and 'N0' indicates that no lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

The 'LOVORO' notation indicates that the lymph nodes were removed and examined, but no cancer was found (L = left side, O = right side, V = axillary, R = rotator, O = other). Therefore, the pathologic N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."
