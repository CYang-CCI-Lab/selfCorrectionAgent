This is consistent with N1, as per Rule 12 (N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The other sentinel lymph node (sentinel node #2, level II) and the non-sentinel lymph node from the left axilla were both benign, with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."

                "text": "The patient has metastatic carcinoma identified in one sentinel lymph node, measuring 0.5 mm (micrometastatic) in one out of the two sentinel lymph nodes examined. This corresponds to pN1mi (isolated tumor cells) according to the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. However, the term 'micrometastasis' is not used in the AJCC manual; therefore, it is more appropriate to stage this as pN1. The 'mi' modifier can be used to indicate that the metastasis is a micrometastasis. However, since the question asks to ignore any substaging information, we will simply use N1."
