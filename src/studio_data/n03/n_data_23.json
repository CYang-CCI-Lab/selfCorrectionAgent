Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present, comprising approximately 5% of the tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. Two out of three sentinel lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma (AJCC pN1), with extranodal extension. Thirteen additional axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
