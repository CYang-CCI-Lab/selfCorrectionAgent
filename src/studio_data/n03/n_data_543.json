Additionally, there are no metastatic carcinomas found in the nonsentinel lymph node biopsy (0/2). The axillary dissection also shows that 19 lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/19). Therefore, based on the rules provided, the patient's N stage is N1, as there are metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
