This is confirmed by both the H&E impression and the immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain. Therefore, based on the new rules 10 and 11, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This means that no cancer cells were found in the sentinel lymph nodes, which is categorized as N0 in the AJCC cancer staging system. The fact that blue dye is identified in all five right axillary sentinel lymph nodes further supports this conclusion, as it indicates that the sentinel lymph nodes were successfully identified and evaluated."
