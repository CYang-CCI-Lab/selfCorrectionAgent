The report also mentions metastatic carcinoma in one of one lymph node in the right axilla (1/1), but it does not specify the total number of lymph nodes assessed in the right axilla. Therefore, we cannot determine the N stage for the right axilla. However, based on the left axilla information, the N stage for this report is N1."

In the left breast, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of 12 lymph nodes (1/12), and in the right breast, there are metastatic carcinomas in two of three lymph nodes (2/3). The highest N stage between the two sides is used, so the N stage is N1."
