This indicates that metastases were found in 2 out of 20 lymph nodes. Based on the new rules provided, this corresponds to N1 stage, as N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."

The TNM staging system defines N1 as 'Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and/or in internal mammary nodes with clinically negative nodes.' However, since there is no mention of internal mammary node involvement in this report, we can conclude that the N stage is N1 based on the axillary lymph node metastases."
