This corresponds to N1 stage according to the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). Additionally, the synoptic report states 'Lymph node status: Positive 1/13', which also supports the N1 stage. The report does not mention in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases, or ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes, so we cannot apply N3 or N2 criteria. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
