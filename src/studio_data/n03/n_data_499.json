The report states that 'One lymph node, negative for metastases (0/1)' for each of the three lymph nodes. This indicates that there are no metastatic carcinomas found in the assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, which means no regional lymph node metastasis."
