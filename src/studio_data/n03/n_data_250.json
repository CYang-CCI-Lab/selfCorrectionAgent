This corresponds to the N3 stage, as per Rule 13: N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes. The exact number of positive lymph nodes is greater than 3 but less than 18, which falls within the range for N3."

In this report, the patient has 17 positive lymph nodes out of 19 found, and the size of the largest metastatic deposit is 2.1 x 1.2 cm. According to the TNM staging system, this would correspond to an N3 stage."
