This corresponds to N3 stage according to Rule 13: N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases."

                "text": "The report indicates that there is a satellite node (a secondary lymph node that has metastasized from the primary tumor) in the skin with a diameter of 0.9 cm. This meets the criteria for N3 stage, which is defined as 'Metastasis in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in infraclavicular (clavipectoral) lymph node(s), or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) by imaging studies (including ultrasound) or by surgical-pathological examination.' In this case, the metastasis to the satellite node in the skin is equivalent to metastasis to an infraclavicular or internal mammary lymph node."
