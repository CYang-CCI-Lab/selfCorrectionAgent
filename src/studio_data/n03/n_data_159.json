The modified Rule 6, Rule 8, and New Rule 10-12 apply here. The report mentions 'pN1' which also supports the N1 stage. Extracapsular extension is identified in one of the lymph nodes, but it does not affect the N stage in this case."

Additionally, extracapsular extension is identified in one of the involved lymph nodes (ECE+). The total number of examined lymph nodes is 4, and 2 of them have metastatic carcinoma (2/4 = 0.5, rounded up to 1 for the pN1 category). The substaging information (e.g., N1mi, N1a, N1b, or N1c) is not provided, so only the main N stage category should be determined."
