This corresponds to a pathologic N stage of N3, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer. The N stage is assigned based on the number of lymph nodes involved, and in this case, the patient has metastases in 10 out of 10 examined lymph nodes. This is a strong indicator of advanced disease and a higher risk of recurrence."
