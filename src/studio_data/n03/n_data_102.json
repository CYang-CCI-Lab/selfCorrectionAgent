Based on the given rules, when no information is available about the lymph nodes, we assume Nx. However, since the report mentions 'carcinoma ductale invasivum' and provides the tumor size (pT2), it suggests that the lymph nodes were assessed and found to be negative for metastases. Therefore, the N stage is most likely N0, as per new rules 10 and 11, which indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or all assessed lymph nodes being negative for metastatic carcinoma."

Therefore, based on the given information, the N stage cannot be determined, and the most appropriate answer is N0, which indicates no regional lymph node involvement."
