In the right breast, there is multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma, and metastatic carcinoma was found in one of two axillary lymph nodes (1/2). Additionally, in the right axillary contents, levels 1 and 2, twenty lymph nodes were negative for metastases (0/20). However, the report mentions that there are a total of 27 lymph nodes assessed, and metastases were found in 4 of those nodes. Therefore, the N stage is N2, as per Rule 14 (N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes)."

In sentinel lymph node #2, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of one lymph node. In sentinel lymph node #3, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of one lymph node with focal extranodal extension. In the additional sentinel lymph node in the right axilla, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of two lymph nodes. However, in the right axillary contents levels 1 and 2, all 20 lymph nodes are negative for metastases. Therefore, the N stage is N2 (metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular lymph nodes) according to the TNM staging system."
