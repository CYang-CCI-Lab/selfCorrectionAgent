The tumor diameter is 5.0 cm and the dorsal resection margin is tumor-free. The pathologic tumor classification is NOS, G II, pT4bN3aLIVORO. According to the rules provided, N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. The report specifies that the N stage is N3a, which corresponds to metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N3."
