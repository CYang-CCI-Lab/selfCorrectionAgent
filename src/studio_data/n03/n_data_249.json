This corresponds to the N1a stage, as per Rule 12 (N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, at least 1 metastasis greater than 2.0 mm). New Rule 10 and New Rule 11 also support this finding, as they mention that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. In this case, the sentinel lymph nodes have metastases, so the N stage is not N0."
