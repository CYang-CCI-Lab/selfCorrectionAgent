In this pathology report, it is stated that a single sentinel lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma and multiple (14 out of 16) axillary lymph nodes are also positive for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N3, as this indicates the presence of cancer in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes."
