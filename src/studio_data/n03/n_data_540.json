This indicates that there are no metastases in the sentinel lymph nodes. Additionally, 'Immunohistochemistry for keratin is negative' for both sentinel nodes. Based on the new rule 11, N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This would correspond to an N0 stage, which means no regional lymph node metastasis was identified. The immunohistochemistry for keratin was also negative, supporting the absence of malignancy in the lymph nodes."
