In this report, it is stated that 'TEN (10) REGIONAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA.' This indicates that the patient has 10 or more positive lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N3 stage. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines N3 as 'Metastasis in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastasis.' In this case, the report mentions axillary lymph nodes, so the N3 stage is confirmed."
