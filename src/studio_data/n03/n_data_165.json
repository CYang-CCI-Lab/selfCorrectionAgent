This corresponds to the N1 stage based on the new rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total). The report also mentions that three lymph nodes from the right axillary and three lymph nodes from the right internal mammary are free of tumor (parts 3, 4, and 6). These details support the N1 stage prediction."
