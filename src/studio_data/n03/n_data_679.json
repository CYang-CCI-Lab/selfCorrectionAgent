This corresponds to N3a in the AJCC staging system. Additionally, the report mentions extracapsular extension in multiple lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N3."

Metastatic carcinoma is present in one of one sentinel lymph node (1/1) with a largest metastatic focus greater than 2.0 cm and extracapsular extension. \\n2. Metastatic carcinoma is present in three of three non-sentinel lymph nodes (3/3) with largest metastatic foci of 9 mm, 4 mm, and 0.22 mm, and extracapsular extension. \\n3. A total of 14 lymph nodes have metastasis, including two with micrometastases. \\n4. Lymphovascular space invasion is identified in perinodal adipose tissue. \\n5. Extracapsular extension is present in both sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes."
