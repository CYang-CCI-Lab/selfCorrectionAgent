According to Rule 12, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, and according to Rule 14, N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. Since 7 lymph nodes have metastases, the N stage is N2."

Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below). Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15). Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue.' This indicates that 7 out of 10 examined lymph nodes have metastasis, with the largest metastasis being 1.3 cm and extracapsular extension is present."
