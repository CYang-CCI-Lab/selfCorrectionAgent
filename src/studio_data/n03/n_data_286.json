In this report, the diagnosis includes 'pT2N1a', where 'pT2' refers to the primary tumor size (>2 cm and up to 5 cm), and 'N1' indicates cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. The 'a' indicates that the metastases are 0.2 mm to 2.0 mm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
