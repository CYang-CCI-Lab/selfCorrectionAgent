This corresponds to N1 stage as per Rule 12 (N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report also mentions that the AJCC pathologic stage is pN1a, which further supports the N1 stage prediction."

The pN1a stage is assigned when there is metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, and the largest deposit is 2 mm or more in greatest dimension. This is supported by the report's statement: 'Metastatic carcinoma in one out of twenty-three lymph nodes (1/23). - Largest metastatic deposit is 2.5 mm.' The 'N0' option can be eliminated because the report clearly states that there is metastasis in one lymph node."
