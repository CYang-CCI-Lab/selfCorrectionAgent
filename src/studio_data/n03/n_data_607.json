In this report, it is stated that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of thirty lymph nodes (1/30) and the metastasis measures 7 mm with no extranodal extension identified. This indicates that the patient has cancer in at least one lymph node, which is classified as N1 stage. The absence of extranodal extension and the fact that only one out of 30 nodes is positive also supports the N1 classification. The specific substaging information, such as N1mi or N1a, cannot be determined without additional information about the location and size of the metastatic deposit in the lymph node."
