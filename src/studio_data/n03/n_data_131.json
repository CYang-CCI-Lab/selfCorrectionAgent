Based on the new rules 10 and 11, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The absence of extracapsular invasion of the lymph nodes and the fact that the report does not mention any other additional pathologic findings that would suggest a higher N stage also support this classification. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."
