This corresponds to the N3 stage as per Rule 13, which states that N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases."

The presence of tumor in the lymphatic vessels of the skin (lymphangitis) and the spread of tumor up to 8 cm in the cavity region indicates a high probability of involvement of at least one lymph node, which is classified as N3. The exact number of positive lymph nodes is not specified in the report, but the N3 stage is appropriate based on the information provided."
