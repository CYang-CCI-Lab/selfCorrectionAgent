The 'N0' in this classification suggests that there are no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (Modified Rule 6, New Rule 10). This is further supported by the '(sn)' in the classification, which stands for 'sentinel lymph node(s)'. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

The report also mentions that the minimum distance to the dorsal margin was 0.3 cm and that other margins were 1 cm and remained free. There is no mention of any lymph node involvement in the report. Therefore, based on the information provided, the pathologic N stage of the patient's cancer is N0, which means that there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis."
