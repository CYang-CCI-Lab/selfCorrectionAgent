This information aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the re-excision specimen does not affect the N stage, as DCIS is a non-invasive form of breast cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes."
