This is explicitly stated in the report, so there is no need to apply the rules for determining the N stage. The report mentions that the patient is diagnosed with breast cancer, specifically infiltrative ductal carcinoma, and the N stage is 1. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."

This suggests that there is cancer found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (or in internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node involvement). The report mentions 'Infiltrative ductal carcinoma' and 'T Stage: 2', which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. The 'M Stage' is '0', indicating no distant metastasis. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
