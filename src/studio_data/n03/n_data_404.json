This indicates that no metastatic carcinoma was found in the sentinel lymph nodes. Based on the new rules 10 and 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
