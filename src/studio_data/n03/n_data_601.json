According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, N stage is determined by the number of lymph nodes with metastases. In this case, N2 corresponds to 'Metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes.' However, the report mentions 'Axillary 8/10' which can be interpreted as 8 out of 10 lymph nodes with metastases. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, the patient's N stage is N2."
