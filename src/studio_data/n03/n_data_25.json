This is supported by New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, Modified Rule 6 and New Rule 10 suggest that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This information is provided in the report under the header 'N Stage: 0'. In the TNM staging system, '0' denotes the absence of cancerous cells in the corresponding location."
