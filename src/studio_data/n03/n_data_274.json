In this pathology report, the relevant information for lymph node involvement is as follows:\\n\\n- Right sentinel lymph node number 1: No evidence of metastatic mammary carcinoma (0/1)\\n- Right sentinel lymph node number 2: No evidence of metastatic mammary carcinoma (0/1)\\n- Right sentinel lymph node number 3: Metastatic infiltrating duct carcinoma, 4.0 mm maximum metastasis dimension without pericapsular invasion, involving one lymph node (1/1)\\n- Right sentinel lymph node number 4: No evidence of metastatic mammary carcinoma (0/1)\\n- Axillary contents, right, dissection: No evidence of metastatic mammary carcinoma in fourteen lymph nodes (0/14)\\n\\nBased on this information, the patient has metastasis in one out of the 18 examined lymph nodes (1/18).
