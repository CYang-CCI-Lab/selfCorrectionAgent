This corresponds to the new rule 10 and new rule 11, which state that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes, or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The 'i-' notation in 'pNO(i-)' indicates that there is no evidence of extranodal extension, but it does not affect the N stage in this case."
