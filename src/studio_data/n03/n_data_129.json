This corresponds to N1 based on the AJCC staging system, as per New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total). The report specifies that there is 1/4 positive lymph nodes, which matches this definition."

The largest metastasis is a macrometastasis, measuring 6 mm, and there is extracapsular extension present in one of the sentinel nodes. The patient does not meet the criteria for N2 or N3 stages as there are no more than 3 positive nodes and there is no evidence of matted nodes or in-transit metastasis."
