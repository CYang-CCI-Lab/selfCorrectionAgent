Based on the new rules provided, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (New Rule 10) or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rule 11). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The substaging information (like N0a, N0b, etc.) is not provided in this report, so we can only determine the main N stage."
