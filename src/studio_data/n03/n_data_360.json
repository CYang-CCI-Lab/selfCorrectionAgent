In this report, metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast origin is identified in multiple (4 out of 16) axillary lymph nodes, with the largest metastatically involved node measuring 3.0 cm in maximum dimension and showing extracapsular tumor extension. This information corresponds to AJCC pN2, which indicates that the cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes and/or has cancer in axillary lymph nodes and in the lymph nodes near the breastbone."
