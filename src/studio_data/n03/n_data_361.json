This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, so it is not N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis). The report also states that the extracapsular extension is absent, so it is not N2 or N3 (both of which would require extracapsular extension). Therefore, the N stage is N1 (metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in axillary sentinel lymph node(s) with metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes)."
