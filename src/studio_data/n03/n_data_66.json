                "text": "The report states that the patient has been diagnosed with a poorly differentiated ductal breast carcinoma with widespread tumor infiltration, including skin ulceration and invasion of lymph vessels and neural sheaths. The tumor has been classified as pT4b pN2, which indicates that the primary tumor is T4b (has invaded the skin and/or chest wall) and that there are metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (N2). This is based on the AJCC staging system and the new rules provided. The report also mentions that there are cutaneous/subcutaneous tumor infiltrates in the region of the cranial resection line, which further supports the presence of lymph node metastases. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."

These findings support a diagnosis of N2 (at least), as per the TNM staging system for breast cancer."
