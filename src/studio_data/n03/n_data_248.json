This information indicates that the cancer has spread to multiple lymph nodes, which corresponds to a more advanced N stage. Based on the AJCC staging system and the new rules provided, N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. In this case, the patient has metastases in 18 out of 20 examined axillary lymph nodes, which satisfies the criteria for N3. Therefore, the predicted N stage for this patient is N3."

Additionally, there is metastatic carcinoma in the left supraclavicular lymph node. These findings support a pathologic N stage of N3."
