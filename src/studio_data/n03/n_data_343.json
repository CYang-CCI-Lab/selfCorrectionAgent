Specifically, the report states 'Number of lymph nodes with macrometastases (>2 mm): 0' and 'Number of lymph nodes with micrometastases (>0.2 mm to 2 mm and/or >200 cells): 0'. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0, as per New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma."
