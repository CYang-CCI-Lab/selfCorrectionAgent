In this report, the patient has 12 positive lymph nodes out of 17 examined (pN3a, 12/17). This indicates that the cancer has spread to a significant number of lymph nodes, which puts the patient in the N3 stage. The other findings in the report, such as the tumor size (pT2), the absence of distant metastasis (pM0), and the clear resection margins (R0), do not factor into the N stage."
