This corresponds to the N2 stage as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 14: N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes). The specific subcategory of N2a (New Rule 15) is not provided in the report, so we can only determine the N2 stage."

This is determined by the fact that there are 7 out of 13 lymph nodes with metastatic adenocarcinoma (7/13) and extracapsular extension is present and measures less than 1 mm. The substaging information (a, b, or c) is not provided in the report, so we cannot make a more specific prediction. The N stage categories are as follows: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or in internal mammary nodes with or without axillary involvement), N2 (metastasis in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes or in clinically apparent ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary metastasis), and N3 (metastasis in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular lymph nodes or in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes and axillary nodes)."
