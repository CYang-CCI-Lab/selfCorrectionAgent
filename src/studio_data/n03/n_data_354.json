In this pathology report, the patient was found to have metastases in lymph nodes, which indicates a positive lymph node status. The 'N' category is further divided based on the number of lymph nodes involved and the presence of extranodal extension. However, the report does not provide information on the total number of lymph nodes examined or the presence of extranodal extension. Based on the information available, the N stage can be determined as N1, as the patient has metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1). The exact N1 subcategory cannot be determined without additional information."
