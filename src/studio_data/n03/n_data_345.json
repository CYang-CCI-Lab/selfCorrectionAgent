This information aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

Additionally, the mastectomy specimen of the left breast revealed five lymph nodes that were also negative for metastases (0/5).
