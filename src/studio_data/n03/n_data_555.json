In this report, the patient has metastases and micrometastases carcinomatosae in 14 out of 16 axillary lymph nodes (No XIV/XVI). This indicates a significant spread of cancer to the lymph nodes, leading to a pathologic N stage of N3. The presence of cancer in the capsule, perinodal tissue, and vascular emboli also supports a more advanced N stage."
