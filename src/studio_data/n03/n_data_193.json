Specifically, sentinel node #1 has 1/6 positive lymph nodes and sentinel node #2 has 1/1 positive lymph nodes. This means a total of 2 out of 7 lymph nodes are positive.

This results in a total of 2/7 positive lymph nodes (rounded to 2/6 or 1/3) which falls under N1 (metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes) stage. There is no extranodal extension of carcinoma. The number of positive lymph nodes in levels II and III is 0/9 and 0/2 respectively."
