The New Rule 10 and 11 also support this finding as they mention N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma, which is not the case here. The report clearly states that 5 out of 17 lymph nodes are positive for metastases."

Additionally, extracapsular extension is present in at least one of the metastatic lymph nodes. However, the substaging information (like N2a, N2b, etc.) is not provided in the report, so I can only determine the main N stage."
