This corresponds to the N1 stage, as per Rule 12 (N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report also mentions that there is no extracapsular extension, which is consistent with N1mi (N1 with micrometastases). However, since the AJCC staging system does not differentiate between N1 and N1mi, we can simply classify this as N1."
