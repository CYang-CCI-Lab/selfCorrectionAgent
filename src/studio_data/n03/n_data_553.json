This corresponds to pN2 (i+) based on the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, which defines N2 as 'Metastasis in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary nodal metastasis.' The 'i+' indicates extracapsular extension."
