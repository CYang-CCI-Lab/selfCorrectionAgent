The 'N1' in the tumor classification refers to the N stage, which indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. This is based on Rule 12, which states that N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."

In this classification, 'pT2' refers to the size of the tumor (>2 cm and up to 5 cm in greatest dimension), 'N1' indicates that cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, 'L1' means that the cancer has spread to the skin of the breast or chest wall, 'V0' indicates no blood vessel invasion, and 'R0' means that no cancer is found at the surgical margin. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
