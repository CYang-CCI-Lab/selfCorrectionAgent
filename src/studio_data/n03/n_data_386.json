However, the wider local excision of the left breast showed invasive and in-situ ductal carcinoma with a size of 2.5 cm. Based on the AJCC staging system and the new rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N1, as there is metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."

In this report, the patient had a wide local excision of the left breast with invasive and in-situ ductal carcinoma, SBR grade III/III with extensive necrosis and cancerization of lobules. The report also mentions that lymph nodes were negative (0/2), meaning that out of the two lymph nodes examined, no cancer was found. Therefore, the patient's N stage is N1, as there is evidence of cancer in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
