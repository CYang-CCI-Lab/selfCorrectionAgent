Specifically, it is an N1a stage since the largest metastatic focus measures 4mm in greatest microscopic dimension and there is no extranodal extension. Therefore, the N stage from this report is N1."

This is stated in the report: 'Regional Nodes [pN]: pN1a: Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0mm). Number involved: 2. Number examined: 13.' The report also mentions 'No extranodal extension is identified,' which is consistent with pN1a."
