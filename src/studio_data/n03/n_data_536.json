This corresponds to N1 based on the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12). The report states 'METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OUT OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1)' for sentinel nodes 1 and 3, which means 2 out of the total 11 lymph nodes are positive. The other lymph nodes, including sentinel node 2 and 9 additional lymph nodes, are all benign (0/9)."

The first sentinel node had metastatic carcinoma (1/1), the second was benign (0/1), and the third had metastatic carcinoma (1/1). Nine additional benign lymph nodes were identified in levels I and II of the left axilla (0/9). The total number of lymph nodes involved is 2, which is less than 3, so the N stage is N1."
