This information corresponds to the N1 stage as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). Therefore, the N stage from this report is N1."

This is based on the pathology report which states that one out of the four sentinel lymph nodes examined had metastatic carcinoma (1/3) with the largest tumor deposit being 2.1 mm and no extracapsular extension present. The N stage is determined by the number of lymph nodes with metastatic cancer. N1 stage indicates that there is cancer in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
