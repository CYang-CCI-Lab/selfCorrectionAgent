This matches with the new rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

Specifically, 0 out of 5, 0 out of 1, and 0 out of 1 lymph nodes had metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, the report states 'LYMPH NODES POSITIVE: 0' and 'LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: 7'. Therefore, the pathologic N stage is N0."
