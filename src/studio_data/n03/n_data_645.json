This is supported by multiple rules, including Rule 2, Modified Rule 6, Rule 8, New Rule 10, and New Rule 11. The report specifies that the patient is a female with a diagnosis of breast cancer, specifically infiltrative ductal carcinoma in the right breast. The T stage is 2, and there is no mention of metastases in the lymph nodes (N stage) or other areas (M stage). The normal blood sample type also supports the absence of metastases. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
