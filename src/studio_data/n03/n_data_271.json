Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, as there are no positive lymph nodes."

Specifically, sentinel lymph nodes 1 and 2, as well as non-sentinel lymph nodes from levels 1 and 2, were all benign (0/1). Therefore, the patient's N stage would be N0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis."
