This means that there are positive lymph nodes in two of the sentinel lymph nodes. Based on the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to N1 (N1mi, N1a, or N1b). The report does not provide information about the number of lymph nodes in the left axillary contents, but it does mention that sixteen lymph nodes were negative for metastases (0/16). This information is not relevant for the determination of the N stage based on the number of positive lymph nodes."

                "text": "The N stage for a cancer patient is determined by the presence and extent of cancer in the lymph nodes. In this report, the patient has cancer in two out of six sentinel lymph nodes (SLN #1 and SLN #4) and no cancer in the other three sentinel lymph nodes (SLN #2, SLN #3, and SLN #5). Additionally, a dissection of the left axillary contents revealed 16 lymph nodes, all of which were negative for cancer. Therefore, the patient has cancer in 2 out of a total of 18 lymph nodes (2/18) and would be classified as N1."
