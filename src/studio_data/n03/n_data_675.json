This corresponds to the N0 stage, which indicates no metastases in the regional lymph nodes. The report also mentions 'lymphonodulitis chronica et sinus histiocytosis lymphonodorum (No XI)', which suggests that the lymph nodes were examined but did not contain any metastases. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
