This is supported by New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, Modified Rule 6 and New Rule 10 suggest that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This is based on the information provided in the pathology report, where the N stage is listed as 0. This suggests that no cancer was found in the regional lymph nodes. It's important to note that the report does not mention any substaging information, so we can only determine the N stage as N0."
