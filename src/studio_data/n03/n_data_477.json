This classification suggests that the tumor is T2 (2.1-5 cm), and there are 15 lymph nodes assessed, with metastases found in 5 of those lymph nodes. According to the new rule 15, N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes, which aligns with the information provided in the report. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."

This means that out of 15 lymph nodes examined, 5 were found to contain cancerous cells. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer, a 'pN2' stage indicates that cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or to the infraclavicular (clavipectoral) lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."
