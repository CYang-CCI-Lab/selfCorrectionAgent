This is further supported by the fact that no carcinoma was identified in any of the lymph nodes that were assessed (sentinel lymph nodes #1 and #2 in the left axilla, and other lymph nodes from various locations such as the omentum, left upper peritoneum, and right adnexa). Additionally, the report mentions 'Number of positive lymph nodes: 0' and 'Lymph node status: Negative'."
