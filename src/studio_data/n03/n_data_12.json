This corresponds to N1 as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report mentions 'Positive 2 / 15' in the synoptic report, confirming the N1 stage."

The N stage is determined by the number of positive lymph nodes, and in this case, it is N1 (1-3 positive axillary nodes). The substaging information, such as the exact number of positive lymph nodes or the presence of extranodal extension, is not considered for the initial N stage determination."
