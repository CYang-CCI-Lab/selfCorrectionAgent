The report also states that there are no positive lymph nodes (pT2N0(0/3;sn)). This means that none of the 3 assessed lymph nodes had metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, as there are no positive lymph nodes."

In this report, the pT2N0(0/3;sn)LOVORO classification indicates that there is no evidence of cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0). This is because the 'N0' component is present in the classification. The '0/3' indicates that zero out of three examined lymph nodes had cancer involvement. The 'sn' denotes that sentinel lymph nodes were examined. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
