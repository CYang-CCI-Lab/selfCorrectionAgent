Specifically, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of the six sentinel lymph nodes (rule 12 and rule 15). The other five sentinel lymph nodes do not have metastatic carcinoma (rules 11 and 15). Additionally, there is no evidence of metastases in the ten non-sentinel lymph nodes (rule 15). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."

Specifically, there is metastatic carcinoma in one of the sentinel lymph nodes (sentinel node #1 count #) and no malignancy was found in the remaining 16 lymph nodes examined. This indicates that the N stage is N1."
