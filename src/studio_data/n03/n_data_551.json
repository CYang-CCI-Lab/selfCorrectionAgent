The size of the micrometastasis is less than 0.2 mm. This information matches with New Rule 12, which states that N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total). Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."

In the left axillary sentinel lymph node excision, multiple sentinel lymph nodes showed one cluster of cells visible on cytokeratin immunohistochemistry stain only, with a micrometastasis size of less than 0.2 mm (blue dye present in both left axillary sentinel lymph nodes).
