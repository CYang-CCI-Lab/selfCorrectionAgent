The concluding tumor classification is NOS, G III, pT2N1aLOVORO. The 'N1a' in the pTNM staging indicates that there is metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 based on the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12). Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."

In this pathology report, the diagnosis is poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with a tumor diameter of 2.2 cm, and it specifies a pT2N1a staging. The 'pT2' indicates the tumor size, and 'N1' indicates that there is cancer in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the pathologic N stage for this patient is N1."
