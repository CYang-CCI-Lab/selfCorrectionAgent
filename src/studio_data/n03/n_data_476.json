Based on the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to N1 (Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report also mentions that a large lymph node was reprocessed and found to be negative for malignancy, but this does not change the fact that at least one lymph node was positive, so the N stage remains N1."
