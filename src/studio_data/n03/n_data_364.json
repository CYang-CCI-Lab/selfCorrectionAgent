This is supported by New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Furthermore, Modified Rule 6 and New Rule 10 suggest that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This is based on the information provided in the pathology report, where the N stage is listed as 0. The N stage is determined by the presence or absence of cancer in the regional lymph nodes, and in this case, there is no evidence of lymph node involvement."
