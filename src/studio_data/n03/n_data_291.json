The report states 'pNO(sn)', which indicates that there are no positive lymph nodes (N0) based on the Modified Rule 6, Rule 8, New Rule 10, and New Rule 11. The report also mentions 'Estrogen receptors found in 75% of neoplastic cell nuclei. Progesterone receptors found in 75% of neoplastic cell nuclei. HER2 protein stained with. HER-2/neu (4B5). HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody. Negative reaction in invasive cancerous cells ( Score = 1+). The expression of proliferating nuclear antigen Ki 67 in 10 % cellular nuclei.', but this information is not relevant to determining the N stage."

The report states 'pNO(sn)', which means that no cancer was found in the sampled lymph nodes (if any were removed and examined). Therefore, the pathologic N stage for this patient is N0, indicating no regional lymph node involvement."
