However, the report does not provide an exact number of positive lymph nodes. Instead, it mentions 'No' positive lymph nodes, which could mean that the number is not available or not specified. The 'X' in 'No/X' might indicate that the number of assessed lymph nodes is not provided. Given the information available, we can only determine that the N stage is at least N1, as N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. The exact N stage might be higher if more lymph nodes are positive, but the report does not provide enough information to make a more precise determination. Therefore, the N stage is predicted to be N1 based on the available information."

The 'N' stage for cancer that has spread to movable ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes is N1. The 'No' and 'X' in the report likely refer to the number of positive lymph nodes and the total number of lymph nodes examined, respectively, but this information is not necessary for determining the N stage."
