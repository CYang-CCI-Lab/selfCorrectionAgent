The pathology report for the sentinel lymph nodes indicates that there is no tumor found in the three assessed lymph nodes (0/3). Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, which indicates no metastatic carcinoma in the sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes."
