This means a total of 5 out of 5 assessed lymph nodes have metastatic carcinomas. Based on the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to N2 (N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes)."

In this report, the patient has metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 3 lymph nodes in the left axillary contents (Part 2) and 2 of 2 lymph nodes in the left axillary contents (Part 3), making a total of 5 out of 5 lymph nodes involved. Additionally, extracapsular extension is present in the intra mammary lymph node (Part 1). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N2."
