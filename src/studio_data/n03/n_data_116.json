This corresponds to N1 stage according to the AJCC staging system. Specifically, the report indicates pN1a, which refers to metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. However, the report does not provide information about the exact number of positive lymph nodes between 1 and 3, so we cannot determine a more specific N1 substage."
