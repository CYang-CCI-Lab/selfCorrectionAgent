This is confirmed by the absence of metastatic carcinoma in both sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes, New Rule 10 and N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma, New Rule 11). Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This is consistent with the N0 stage, which means that the cancer has not spread to the axillary lymph nodes."
