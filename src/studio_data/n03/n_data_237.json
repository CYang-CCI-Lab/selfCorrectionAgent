This indicates that metastases were found in 6 out of 10 assessed axillary lymph nodes. According to the provided rules, this corresponds to N2 (N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes)."

In this report, it is stated that there are metastases in 6 out of 10 axillary lymph nodes, which indicates a pathologic N2 stage. The extra capsular extension of the metastases also supports this staging. The T stage is not directly provided in the report, but it is mentioned that the tumor size is 2.0 cm in one location and at least 3.0 cm in another location. The AJCC stage is given as T2N2MX, where M indicates that distant metastasis has not been assessed. Therefore, the N stage from this report is N2."
