Total number examined: 14' in both sections A and C, indicating that no metastatic carcinoma was found in any of the 14 lymph nodes assessed. This aligns with the definitions provided in New Rule 11 and Rule 8, which state that N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in all assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
