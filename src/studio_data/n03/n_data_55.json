This information supports the N1 stage. The other 17 lymph nodes dissected were negative for metastatic carcinoma. New Rule 12 states that N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, which is consistent with the report."

There is no evidence of extranodal extension, and multiple (17) axillary lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
