This is based on the TNM staging system where N0 means no regional lymph node metastasis, N1 means metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or in internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastasis, N2 means metastasis in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically apparent ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the presence of 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes, and N3 means metastasis in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular (level III) lymph nodes, or in clinically apparent ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the presence of 4 or more positive axillary lymph nodes. The substaging information such as the size of the metastasis or the presence of extracapsular extension does not affect the N stage in this case."
