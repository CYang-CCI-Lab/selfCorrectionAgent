The 'N' in this classification refers to the lymph nodes, and the 'O' indicates that there are no positive lymph nodes. This aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

The 'O' indicates no tumor involvement in the overlying skin (O), and 'R0' indicates a tumor-free resection margin. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
