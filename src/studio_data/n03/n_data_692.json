The report also mentions that the lymph nodes were assessed, and all assessed lymph nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rule 11). However, the presence of metastases in one or more lymph nodes takes precedence over no metastases in assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
