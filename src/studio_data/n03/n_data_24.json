In this report, it is stated that 'LYMPH NODES 1 OF 22 POSITIVE FOR TUMOR (PARTS C-E)' and 'ONE (1) LYMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA' in the non-sentinel left axillary lymph node. This indicates that the cancer has spread to at least one lymph node, but not to more than three lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 stage. The substaging information, such as the size of the metastasis or the number of positive lymph nodes out of the total examined, is not provided in this report, so I am unable to give a more specific N stage."
