Based on the new rules 10 and 11, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

Additionally, the 'LYMPH NODES POSITIVE' field is 0 and 'LYMPH NODES EXAMINED' is 3. The 'N STAGE, PATHOLOGIC' field is 'pNO', which all indicate that there is no evidence of cancer in the regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage is N0."
