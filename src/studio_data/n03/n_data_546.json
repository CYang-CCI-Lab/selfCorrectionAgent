The report does not provide information on the number of positive lymph nodes, but it does indicate that the patient has breast cancer (infiltrative ductal carcinoma) and that the N Stage is 1. Therefore, based on Rule 12, which states that N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, and the information provided in the report, the predicted N stage for this patient is N1."

This suggests that there is cancer found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (or in the inframammary nodes in the absence of axillary nodes) and/or in internal mammary nodes with micro metastasis or isolated tumor cells (ITCs) detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection. The report mentions that the patient underwent a radical mastectomy, which typically includes removal of the axillary lymph nodes, and the cancer was found to have metastasized to at least one lymph node. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
