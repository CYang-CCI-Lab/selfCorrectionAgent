This is confirmed by both H&E impression and immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain. Therefore, based on the new rules 10 and 11, the N stage for this patient is N0, indicating no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma."
