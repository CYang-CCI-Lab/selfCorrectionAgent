The first node has a metastatic focus of 2.1 mm and no extracapsular extension, while the second node has a metastatic focus of 7 mm with extracapsular extension. This information indicates that the patient has metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 based on the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12)."

Additionally, sentinel lymph node #3 has metastatic carcinoma measuring 7 mm with extracapsular extension. There is no information about more than 4 positive nodes or fixed/matted nodes.
