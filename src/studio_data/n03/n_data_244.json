In this report, it is stated that multiple (6 out of 17) left axillary lymph nodes are involved by metastatic lobular carcinoma. This means that the cancer has spread to at least 6 lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N2 stage. The focal extracapsular extension also supports this staging. The N stage is not further subclassified in this report."
