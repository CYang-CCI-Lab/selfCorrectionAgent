This information aligns with New Rule 11 and New Rule 10, which state that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The substaging information is not provided, so I am ignoring it for this question."
