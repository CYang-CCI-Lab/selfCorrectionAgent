This corresponds to N1 stage as per the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report mentions 'A single (of 6) lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]', which supports this prediction."

In this pathology report, it is stated that 'A single (of 6) lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]' and 'Multiple (6) axillary lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]'. This indicates that a total of 1 out of 7 lymph nodes tested positive for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
