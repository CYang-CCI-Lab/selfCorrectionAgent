In this report, the left sentinel lymph nodes (1 and 2) and the second right sentinel lymph node are negative for metastatic carcinoma. However, the first right sentinel lymph node is positive for isolated tumor cells (less than 200 cells) on H&E and cytokeratin immunostaining. According to the new rule 10 and 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

In this report, the left axillary sentinel lymph nodes (No. 1 and 2) are negative for metastatic carcinoma, and the right axillary sentinel lymph node No. 2 is also negative. The right axillary sentinel lymph node No. 1 has isolated tumor cells (less than 200 cells) on H&E and cytokeratin immunostaining, which is considered pN0(i+) according to the AJCC staging system, but it is still considered N0 for the purpose of this question as it does not meet the criteria for N1. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
