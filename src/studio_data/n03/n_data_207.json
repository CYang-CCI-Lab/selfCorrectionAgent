In this report, it is stated that there are 3 lymph nodes examined, and 2 of them are positive for metastatic carcinoma. One of the positive lymph nodes has a metastasis size of 0.9 cm, and the other one has rare clusters of metastatic tumor cells in the peripheral sinus. Therefore, the patient's N stage is N1."
