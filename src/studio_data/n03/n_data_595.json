Additionally, no other lymph nodes were identified in the additional axillary tail right breast specimen. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, which indicates no metastatic carcinoma in the assessed lymph nodes."

This indicates that no cancer was found in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were removed and examined. The N stage is determined by the number of involved lymph nodes. In this case, since no lymph nodes contained cancer, the N stage is N0."
