Based on the new rules 10 and 11, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The N stage is used to describe the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes, with N0 indicating no cancer in the lymph nodes."
