Based on the new rules 10 and 11, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This means that the patient's cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The absence of extracapsular invasion of the lymph nodes also supports this staging. The Nottingham Histologic Score cannot be determined from the report, but it does not affect the N stage determination."
