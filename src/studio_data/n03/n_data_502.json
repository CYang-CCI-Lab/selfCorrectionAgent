The '(sn)' indicates that the metastases were found in the sentinel lymph nodes. Based on the rules provided, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, which aligns with the information in the report. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."

The '(sn)' indicates that sentinel lymph node(s) were examined and found to contain micrometastasis. Therefore, the N stage is N1, as micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes is classified as N1."
