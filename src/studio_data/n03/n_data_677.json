This corresponds to N1 based on the AJCC staging system (New Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The other lymph nodes (#2, #3, #5, and levels 1 and 2 of the left axilla) do not have metastases. The report also mentions that there are no metastases in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases, which rules out N3."

                "text": "The patient's pathologic N stage can be determined by the involvement of the sentinel lymph nodes. In this report, two sentinel lymph nodes were identified and examined. One of these nodes had metastatic carcinoma involvement (1/1), and the other was benign (0/1). This means that there is cancer in at least one axillary lymph node, but the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes above the collarbone or in the interior of the chest. Therefore, the N stage is N1, as per the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual."
