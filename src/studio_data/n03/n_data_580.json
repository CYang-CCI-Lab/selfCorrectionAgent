This is based on the pathology report which indicates that there is metastatic carcinoma present in 1 out of 1 sentinel lymph node in the left axilla (SLN #1) and metastatic carcinoma present in 1 out of 22 lymph nodes in the left axillary contents (E). The report also mentions extranodal extension in SLN #2, but this is not used in determining the N stage. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, N1 indicates that there is cancer in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
