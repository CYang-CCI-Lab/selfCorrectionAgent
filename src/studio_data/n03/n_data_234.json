The tumor has been classified as NOS, G III, pT2N0(sn)LOVORO. According to the rules provided, N0 indicates no positive lymph nodes. Specifically, the notation (sn) in N0(sn) indicates that there are no metastatic carcinomas in the sentinel lymph nodes. Therefore, based on this information, the pathologic N stage of the patient's cancer is N0."

The '(sn)' indicates that sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed and no cancer was found in the sentinel node(s). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
