This information aligns with New Rule 11 and Rule 8, which state that N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in all assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The immunohistochemical studies also support this finding as they were negative for metastatic carcinoma."
