This information aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This means that there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The N stage is not affected by the substaging information."
