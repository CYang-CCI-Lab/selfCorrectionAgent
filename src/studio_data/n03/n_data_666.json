The immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain also confirmed the absence of tumor in the sentinel lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the new rules 10 and 11, the N stage for this patient is N0, as all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma and there is no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes."
