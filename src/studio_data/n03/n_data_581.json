According to the new rule 13, N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. The 'N3a' in the tumor classification suggests that there are metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to N3. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N3."
