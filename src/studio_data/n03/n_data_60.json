This corresponds to an N3 stage when ignoring any substaging information. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines N3 as 'metastasis in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in infraclavicular (clapboard) lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes (immediately deep to the posterior edge of the ribs), or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes and axillary lymph nodes.' In this case, the patient has 14 positive axillary lymph nodes, which falls under the N3 category."
