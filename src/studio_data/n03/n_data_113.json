Based on the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to N1. The report also mentions that the lymph nodes show infiltratio capsulae lymphonodi et telae perinodalis, which supports the presence of metastases. The new rules provided are consistent with this classification."

This indicates that there are cancer metastases in 1 out of 8 axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pathologic N stage of N1. The report also provides the detail 'pN1a', but for the purpose of this question, we are asked to ignore any substaging information."
