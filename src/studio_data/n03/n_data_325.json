The report states: 'A. LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 -. POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1/1); THE TUMOR INVOLVES THREE-FOURTHS OF THE NODE WHICH MEASURES .6. CM. IN DIAMETER, NO PERICAPSULAR SOFT TISSUE EXTENSION.' This means that the node had cancer cells in 75% of its volume, and there was no evidence of soft tissue extension. The other two nodes (specimens B and C) were negative for metastatic carcinoma, as they had no cancer cells detected in them. Therefore, the N stage is N1, according to the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual."
