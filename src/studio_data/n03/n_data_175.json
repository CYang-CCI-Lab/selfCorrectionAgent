This corresponds to a pathologic N1 stage, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The N stage is determined by the number of lymph nodes involved, and in this case, a single positive lymph node falls under N1. The absence of extracapsular invasion or substaging information does not affect the N1 classification."
