There is no mention of extracapsular extension in the non-sentinel lymph nodes, but the presence of metastatic carcinoma in ten lymph nodes is sufficient for an N3 classification. The report also mentions that there are metastatic carcinoma in the sentinel lymph nodes (1/1) but this is not taken into account for N staging as the non-sentinel lymph nodes are also involved."
