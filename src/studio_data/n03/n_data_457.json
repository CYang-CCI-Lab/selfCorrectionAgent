It states 'Metastatic adenocarcinoma in three of twenty-nine lymph nodes (3/29) with extracapsular extension.' This means that the cancer has spread to 3 out of 29 lymph nodes, which falls under the N2 category. The report also mentions 'Metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of two lymph nodes (2/2) with extracapsular extension' in the 'Sentinel lymph node right axilla, excision' section, but this should be disregarded as it is a separate specimen and does not apply to the regional lymph nodes. The N stage is determined by the number of involved lymph nodes in the regional lymph node basin, which in this case is the axillary lymph nodes."
