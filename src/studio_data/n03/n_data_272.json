The tumor size is 1.5 cm in diameter and has a malignancy grade of II. The report also mentions that there are no positive lymph nodes (pN0) and that four sentinel lymph nodes (sn) were assessed and found to be negative. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, as all assessed lymph nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma."
