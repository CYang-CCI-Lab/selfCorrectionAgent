This corresponds to N2 according to the AJCC staging system (New Rule 14). The report also mentions that there are multiple matted left axillary sentinel lymph nodes that are positive for metastatic carcinoma with extranodal extension, but since the exact number of positive sentinel lymph nodes is not specified, the N2 stage is determined by the total number of positive lymph nodes (7 out of 28)."
