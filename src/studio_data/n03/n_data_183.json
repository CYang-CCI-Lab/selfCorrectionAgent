This classification suggests that the tumor has metastasized to 15 out of 19 assessed lymph nodes, which corresponds to N3 stage according to Rule 13: N3 indicates metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in in-transit, satellite, or micrometastases (N3mi) in 4 or more lymph nodes, or in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases."
