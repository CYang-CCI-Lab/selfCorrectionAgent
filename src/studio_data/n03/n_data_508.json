Additionally, the axillary dissection shows metastatic carcinoma in 3 out of 17 lymph nodes. Based on these findings, the N stage is N2 (N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes)."

In this report, the sentinel lymph node #2 has metastatic carcinoma in two of the three lymph nodes, with the largest metastasis being 0.7 cm. Additionally, the axillary contents, right, levels 1 and 2, dissection shows metastatic carcinoma in 3 of the 17 lymph nodes, with the largest metastasis being 1.5 cm. Therefore, the patient's N stage is N2."
