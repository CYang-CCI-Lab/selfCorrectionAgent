In this report, it is stated that 'Total number of lymph nodes examined: Ten. Total number of lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma by gross exam or light microscopy: Sentinel, 1/2; Level 1 and II, 1/8.' This indicates that metastatic carcinoma was found in one sentinel lymph node and one additional lymph node, but not in any other lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient would be N1."
