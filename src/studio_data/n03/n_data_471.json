The report specifically mentions 'Negative for metastases (0/1)' for each of the four lymph nodes. This indicates that no metastatic carcinoma was found in any of the assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0, which means no regional lymph node metastasis."
