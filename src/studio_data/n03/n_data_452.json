In this pathology report, the patient has metastatic carcinoma present in 2 out of 25 lymph nodes, with the largest metastasis measuring 4 cm. This information supports the classification of N1 (N: lymph nodes). The specific substaging information is not provided in the report, so we ignore it for this question. The N1 stage is used when there are metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular (claviular) lymph nodes."
