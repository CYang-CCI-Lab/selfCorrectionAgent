This is further supported by Rule 1 and Rule 8, which state that the N stage is determined by the number of positive lymph nodes and that if no lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, the N stage is N0. In this case, since one lymph node is positive for metastasis, the N stage is N1."

This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, so the N stage is not N0. There is no extranodal extension identified, and there are no cancerous nodes found in the right axillary level II nodes (0/9). Therefore, the N stage is N1, as the cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes and the largest metastasis measures 2.0 cm or less."
