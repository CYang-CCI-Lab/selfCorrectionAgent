This is confirmed by New Rule 12, which states that N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total) and is further supported by Modified Rule 6 and New Rules 10 and 11, which mention that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma."

This is based on the TNM staging system for cancer, where pN denotes the pathological nodal stage, and N1 corresponds to metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes."
