This means that there are no metastatic carcinomas in the sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (New Rule 10) and all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rule 11). Therefore, the N stage is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the sentinel lymph nodes, which is consistent with an N0 stage. The substaging information (N0a, N0b, N0c) is not provided in the report, so we can only determine the N0 stage."
