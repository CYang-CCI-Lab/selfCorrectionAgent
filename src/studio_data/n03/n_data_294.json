This means that no metastatic carcinoma was found in the assessed lymph nodes. Based on the new rules provided, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes (New Rule 10) or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (New Rule 11). Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

The 'N' stage in TNM staging system refers to the absence or presence of regional lymph node metastasis. 'N0' stands for no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
