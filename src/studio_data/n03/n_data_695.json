This corresponds to the N1 stage based on the AJCC staging system, as per Rule 9 and New Rule 12 (N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes). The report also mentions that the largest nodal metastasis is 4 mm in diameter, which is consistent with N1 stage. The presence of extracapsular extension in one of the lymph nodes (Slide 1FS) also supports the N1 stage."
