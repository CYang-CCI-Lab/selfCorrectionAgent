The '(1/14)' indicates that 1 out of 14 assessed lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."

This is consistent with a pathologic N1 stage. The '(1/14)' indicates that out of 14 lymph nodes examined, one had cancer. This is also consistent with N1 staging."
