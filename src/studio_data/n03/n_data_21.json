This corresponds to the N1 stage, as per the AJCC staging system and the new rules provided. The report mentions 'LYMPH NODES POSITIVE: 2' and 'LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: 4', which directly supports the N1 stage prediction. The size of the nodal metastases is not a determining factor for the N1 stage, so the size of 0.7 cm does not affect the N stage prediction."

Specifically, there are 2 positive lymph nodes out of 4 examined (report states '2/4' but it should be '1/3' for the second lymph node, still consistent with N1a). The size of the nodal metastasis is 0.7 cm, which is less than 2 cm. There is no extracapsular extension mentioned in the report."
