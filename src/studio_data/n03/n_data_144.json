Based on the new rule 10 and rule 11, N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

The report mentions 'pNO (SN)', which means no lymph node metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node(s). Since there is no mention of any lymph node involvement beyond the sentinel node(s), we can assume that the N stage is N0."
