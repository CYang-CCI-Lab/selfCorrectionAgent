This information aligns with New Rule 11 and Rule 8, which state that N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in all assessed lymph nodes. Therefore, the pathologic N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This means that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The absence of extracapsular invasion of the lymph nodes also supports this classification. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."
