This corresponds to the N3 stage according to the AJCC staging system (New Rule 13). The report also mentions focal extranodal involvement, which supports the N3 stage. The exact number of positive lymph nodes is within the range specified for N3 (4 or more axillary lymph nodes). Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N3."
