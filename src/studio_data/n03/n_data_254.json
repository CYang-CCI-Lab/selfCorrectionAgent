This information aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the sentinel lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The presence of invasive ductal carcinoma in the breast does not affect the N stage in this case, as it is based solely on the absence or presence of cancer in the lymph nodes."
