According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, 'Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm, or single tumor cells, or groups of tumor cells numbering fewer than 200, which are typically detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC).' Since ITCs are not considered as metastatic cancer, the patient's N stage is N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)."
