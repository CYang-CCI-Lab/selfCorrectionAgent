Additionally, the surgical specimen from the breast (specimen C) did not have ductal carcinoma in situ or vessel invasion identified. The closest margin was 1.5 mm from the posterior aspect of the breast specimen, but a separately submitted new posterior margin (specimen D) was negative for malignancy. Therefore, based on the information provided, the patient's pathologic N stage is N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)."
