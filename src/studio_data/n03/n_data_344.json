This information supports the N1 stage, which is defined as 'Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular (clavicular) lymph nodes.' (TNM staging system, American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edition). The exact number of positive lymph nodes is not specified, but the presence of metastasis in at least one lymph node is confirmed. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
