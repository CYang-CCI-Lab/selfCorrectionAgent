This indicates that there are no positive lymph nodes, which corresponds to N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) as per the AJCC staging system. The new rules 10 and 11 also support this finding, as they specify that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma."

No evidence of metastatic tumor was found in these nodes, as stated in the 'Linical Diagnoses' section: 'NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC TUMOR ON H&E. STEP SECTIONS OR CYTOKERATIN STAINS IN 4 LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.' Therefore, the patient's N stage is N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)."
