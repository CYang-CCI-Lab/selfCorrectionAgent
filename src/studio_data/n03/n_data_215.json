The report mentions 'pNo/sn/' which, according to the rules provided, indicates that there are no metastatic carcinomas in the sentinel lymph nodes (sn) and that the regional lymph nodes (No) are also free of metastases. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0, which means there is no evidence of lymph node involvement."

The 'pNo' in the histopathological diagnosis indicates that no cancer was found in the lymph nodes that were examined. However, since the axillary tissues were not removed, this means that the lymph nodes were not examined. Therefore, the N stage is N0, which indicates no regional lymph node involvement."
