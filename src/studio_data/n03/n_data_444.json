This corresponds to the N1 stage, as per Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (No/Total). The report also states that 'TUMOR PRESENT OUTSIDE LYMPH BODES', which confirms the presence of metastases in regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."

This corresponds to an N1 stage, as N1 stage indicates cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. The additional information about tumor present outside of lymph nodes does not affect the N stage classification."
