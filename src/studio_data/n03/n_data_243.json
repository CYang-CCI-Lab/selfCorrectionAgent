The N stage is used to describe the spread of cancer to the regional lymph nodes. N0 means no lymph node involvement, N1 means 1-3 axillary lymph nodes are involved, N2 means 4-9 axillary lymph nodes are involved, and N3 means 10 or more axillary lymph nodes are involved. In this case, the patient has N1 stage cancer."
