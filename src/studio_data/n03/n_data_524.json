Therefore, based on the given rules, the N stage would be N1 (Rule 12: N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes)."

This means that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, which is classified as N1 stage. The specific number of involved lymph nodes or their size is not provided in the report, so we cannot determine if it's N1a, N1b, or N1c. Therefore, we can only conclude that the N stage is N1."
