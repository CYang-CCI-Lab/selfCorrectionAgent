In this case, 'N1' indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. This is based on Rule 12, which states that N1 corresponds to metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. The 'N1a' in the report supports this, indicating that there is metastasis in a single axillary lymph node."

Specifically, N1a suggests that there is metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N1."
