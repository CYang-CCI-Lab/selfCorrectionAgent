This matches with the new rules 10 and 11, which state that N0 can indicate no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0."

However, there is no information in the report about the involvement of nearby lymph nodes (N stage). In the absence of such information, the N stage is typically assumed to be N0, indicating no regional lymph node involvement."
