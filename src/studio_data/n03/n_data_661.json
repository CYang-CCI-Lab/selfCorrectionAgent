This indicates that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The presence of mucinous carcinoma in the adipose tissue at the inked medial margin of resection in the pectoralis fascia specimen does not affect the N stage as it is a separate specimen from the sentinel nodes."
