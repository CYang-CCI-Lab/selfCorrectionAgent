In this report, it is mentioned that there are metastases and micrometastases in axillary lymph nodes (NHG2; pT2; pN3a). Further, the report mentions 'Metastases et micrometastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis axillae (No XXV/XXVIII)', which means that out of 28 examined lymph nodes, 25 had cancer involvement. This places the patient in N3 stage, as N3 stage is defined as metastasis in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular (claviicular) lymph nodes."
