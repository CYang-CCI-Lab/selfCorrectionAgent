This information aligns with New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient's cancer is N0."

This indicates that cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The fact that immunohistochemical stains for keratin were not used does not change this assessment, as the absence of malignant cells in the lymph node is the key factor in determining the N stage."
