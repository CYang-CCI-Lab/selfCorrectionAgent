Additionally, there were no regional lymph node metastases identified histologically or by immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3. Therefore, based on the rules provided, the N stage for this patient is N0."

This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the sentinel lymph node, which corresponds to an N0 stage. The absence of tumor in the regional lymph nodes is also confirmed by the pTNM staging at the end of the report."
