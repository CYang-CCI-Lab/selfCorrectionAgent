The report also mentions that 0 out of 11 lymph nodes were positive for metastasis. Based on the rules provided, this corresponds to an N0 stage, which indicates no metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes. This is further supported by New Rule 11, which states that N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma."
