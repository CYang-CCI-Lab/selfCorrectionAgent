According to the report, sentinel lymph node #1 and #2 are positive for metastatic carcinoma, and 2 out of 13 axillary lymph nodes are also positive for malignancy. This information corresponds to a pathologic N2 stage, which indicates that cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or to the infraclavicular (claviicular) lymph nodes. The exact number of positive lymph nodes in this case is 3 out of 13, but for the purpose of N stage, N2 is the appropriate classification."
