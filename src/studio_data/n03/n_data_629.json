This indicates that the cancer has spread to at least one and up to nine axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 stage.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines N1 as 'Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in infraclavicular (clavipectoral) nodes, and/or axillary micrometastases'."
