The report only mentions that a lymph node sampling was performed on the right side, but it does not specify the number of lymph nodes or whether they were positive for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage cannot be determined based on the information provided and is designated as NX."

The tumor involves all quadrants, and it has a histologic grade of 9 (grade III or G3). The tumor invades the skeletal muscle and the deep margin, and there is dermal lymphatic invasion. However, the number of lymph nodes involved is not specified in the report. Therefore, based on the information provided, the N stage is N2, which indicates that cancer has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or to the infraclavicular (clavipectoral) lymph node."
