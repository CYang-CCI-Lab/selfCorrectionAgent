In this report, the pathologic N stage can be determined from Part 4, which describes the sentinel lymph node biopsy from the right side. It indicates the presence of metastatic carcinoma involving one lymph node with a metastatic focus of 1.2 cm in greatest diameter and extracapsular extension of 0.5 cm x 0.2 cm.
