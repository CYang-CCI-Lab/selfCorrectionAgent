This indicates that the cancer has spread to 8 or more axillary lymph nodes, which is classified as N2 according to the TNM staging system for cancer. Extracapsular extension refers to the spread of cancerous cells through the capsule of a lymph node and into the surrounding tissue, which is also indicative of a more advanced cancer stage."
