However, the report also states 'NUMEROUS FOCI OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA ARE NOTED IN THE AXILLARY SOFT TISSUE, WITH THE LARGEST MEASURING AT LEAST 1.4 CM' which suggests a more advanced stage of lymph node involvement. Therefore, based on Rule 14, the patient's N stage would be N2."

This information supports the classification of N2, which refers to cancer that has spread to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or to the infraclavicular (clavipectoral) lymph nodes."
