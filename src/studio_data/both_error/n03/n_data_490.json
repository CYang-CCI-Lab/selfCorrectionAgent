The report states 'Metastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis axillae (No II/II) (NHG2, pT2, pNla)', indicating that 2 out of 2 assessed lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma, which falls within the criteria for N1."

This indicates that there are cancerous metastases in the axillary lymph nodes. The Roman numerals II/II suggest that 2 out of 2 (or 100%) of the examined lymph nodes contain metastases. However, the N stage is not determined by the proportion of positive nodes, but rather by the number of positive nodes. Since there are metastases in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, the N stage is N1."
