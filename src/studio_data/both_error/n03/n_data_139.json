However, based on the information provided, there is no mention of any metastases in the lymph nodes. Therefore, according to New Rule 11, N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Thus, the N stage is N0."

In this report, it is stated that 'Nx' was diagnosed, which means that the lymph nodes couldn't be assessed. However, based on the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, there is no mention of any lymph node involvement. Therefore, the N stage for this patient would be N0, indicating no cancer was found in the lymph nodes."
