In the right axillary contents levels 1 and 2, metastatic carcinoma is found in 4 out of 24 lymph nodes. Based on the new rules provided, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. Since metastases are found in 1 out of 2 sentinel lymph nodes and 4 out of 24 lymph nodes in the axillary contents levels 1 and 2, the N stage is N1."
