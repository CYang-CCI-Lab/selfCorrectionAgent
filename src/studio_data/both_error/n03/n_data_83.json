Based on the new rules provided, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. However, the report does not specify the exact location of the metastases, so we cannot determine if it's in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes only. But, since the report mentions 'lymph nodes positive' and does not mention any other specific locations such as internal mammary or in-transit/satellite/micrometastases, we can assume it's within the range of N1. Therefore, the predicted N stage is N1."

This means that the cancer has spread to at least one regional lymph node and the number of positive nodes is between 4 and 9, which falls under N2."
