This corresponds to N2, which indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. The specific number of positive lymph nodes is not explicitly stated as 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, but it is clear that it falls within this range. Extranodal extension was also present, but this does not affect the N stage."

This corresponds to an N2 stage, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer. The AJCC system classifies N1 as 1-3 positive nodes, N2 as 4-9 positive nodes, and N3 as 10 or more positive nodes. The presence of extranodal extension also supports the N2 classification."
