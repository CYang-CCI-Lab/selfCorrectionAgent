However, the report does not provide enough information to determine the exact N stage based on the new rules provided. Based on the information available, we can only determine that the patient has some positive lymph nodes. According to the AJCC staging system, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is most likely N1."

The T stage is 1c, N stage is 1a, and M stage is 0, with no further treatment provided. The N stage 1a indicates that there are ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastases, with the metastases in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes and all detected cancer deposits being \u2264 2.0 mm. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
