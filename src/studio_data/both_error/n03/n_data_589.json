The report also mentions that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of two intramammary lymph nodes (1/2), but this information is not used in determining the N stage for this case."

WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION' and 'METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWO INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODES (1/2), MEASURING 0.8-CM. WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION'. This indicates that there is metastasis in 1 out of 12 axillary lymph nodes and 1 out of 2 intramammary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage is N1."
