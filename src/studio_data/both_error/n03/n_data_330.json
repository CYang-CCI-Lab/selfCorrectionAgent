According to the new rules provided, N0 indicates no metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes and regional lymph nodes or that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Since there is no information about the lymph nodes in the report, we can assume that the lymph nodes were assessed and found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma, making the N stage N0."

The report includes gross and microscopic assessment of the tumor, tumor type, site, distance to the closest margin, and histological diagnosis. However, there is no mention of lymph node involvement. Therefore, based on the information provided, the N stage would be N0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis."
