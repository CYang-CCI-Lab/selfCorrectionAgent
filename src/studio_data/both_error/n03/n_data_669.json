The N stage is determined based on the number of lymph nodes with metastases. In this case, N1 corresponds to metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in internal mammary lymph nodes with or without axillary lymph node metastases. The report specifies that the metastases were found in axillary lymph nodes, so the N stage is N1."
