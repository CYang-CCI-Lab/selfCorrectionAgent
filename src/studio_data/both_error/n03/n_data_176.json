This is stated in the microscopic description as 'Axillary lymph nodes: Lymphonodultis chronica et sinus histiocytosis (No. VI)'. According to the new rule 11, N0 can indicate that all assessed lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N0 or pNO, which means no metastasis in the lymph nodes."

This indicates that 6 lymph nodes were found to contain metastatic cancer. The N stage for breast cancer is determined by the number of involved lymph nodes, with N0 indicating no cancer in the lymph nodes and N1 indicating metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
