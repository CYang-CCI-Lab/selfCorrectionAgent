This is confirmed by New Rule 14, which states that N2 indicates metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. The report also mentions metastatic carcinoma in the sentinel lymph node, but the N stage is determined by the number of positive lymph nodes in the regional lymph nodes, which in this case is the left axillary contents. Therefore, the N stage is N2."
