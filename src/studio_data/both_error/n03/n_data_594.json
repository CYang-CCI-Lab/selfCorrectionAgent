This is explicitly stated in the report, so there is no need to infer it from other pieces of information. The report does not contain information about the specific number of positive lymph nodes, but it does indicate that at least one lymph node has metastases, which is sufficient to determine the N stage as N1. The other rules provided do not apply to this report, as they refer to specific scenarios that are not mentioned in the report."

The report does not provide further details on the number of lymph nodes involved, so we can only conclude the N1 stage."
