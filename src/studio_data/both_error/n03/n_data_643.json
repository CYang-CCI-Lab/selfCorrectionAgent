This is because there is metastatic carcinoma present in the sentinel lymph node (specimen C), but there is no evidence of malignancy in the axillary contents (specimen D). The 'c' in pN1c indicates that the metastasis is 'clinically apparent' but not 'pathologically confirmed' in the axillary lymph nodes. This is based on the absence of malignancy in specimen D. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
