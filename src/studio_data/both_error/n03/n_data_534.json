This indicates that the patient has metastases in 4 out of 10 lymph nodes at level 1. According to Rule 12, N1 indicates metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. However, the AJCC staging system considers metastases in 4 or more axillary lymph nodes as N2. Therefore, the N stage for this patient is N1."
