This corresponds to an N1 stage, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The N stage is based on the number of lymph nodes involved, and in this case, N1 corresponds to metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. The report does not mention extracapsular invasion, which is not required for determining the N stage. The substaging information is not provided, so we should ignore it for this question."
