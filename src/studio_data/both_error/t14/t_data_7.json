Since this is an incisional biopsy of invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, we use the largest dimension of the tumor to determine the T stage. In this case, the largest dimension is 3.1 cm, which falls in the T2 category (more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm). Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

                "text": "The T stage of a cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures. In this report, the size of the biopsy is given as 3.1 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm, and it is described as a 'firm white-tan ill-defined lesion that extends to the inked surgical margin.' The fact that the tumor is large enough to be visible on gross examination and extends to the surgical margin indicates that it is at least 2 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage is T2. This is consistent with the N.S.A.B.P. TNM staging system, which defines T2 as a tumor that is 2-5 cm in size."
