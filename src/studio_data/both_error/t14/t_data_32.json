According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size. Since the report specifies T1c, it suggests that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not directly extended to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T1."

The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less in size. T1 is further divided into three substages (T1a, T1b, T1c) based on the size of the tumor. T1c indicates a tumor size of 1.1 to 2 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1."
