The first lesion in the 10 o'clock position measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 1.2 cm and extends to within less than 1 mm of the superficial margin. The second lesion in the 11 o'clock position measures approximately 1.9 cm of invasive carcinoma associated with 2.2 cm of duct carcinoma in situ and is 5 mm from the deep margin. Since the largest invasive tumor size is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, the T stage is T2, according to the TNM staging system for breast cancer."
