The largest of these masses is 2.0 cm, which falls under the T2 category of tumors that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the pathologic T stage of the patient's cancer is T2."

This puts the tumor size in the T2 category (T2: Tumor size > 2.0 cm and \u2264 5.0 cm). The presence of perineural invasion, close margins, and invasive tumor within 0.1 cm from the medial margin do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor only."
