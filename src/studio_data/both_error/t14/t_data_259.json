The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, and the maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is used to determine the T stage. The T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T2 category applies to tumors that are greater than 2 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm. The report also mentions that the tumor is involving superior, inferior, medial, and anterior surgical margins, but since the size is already confirmed as 4.7 cm, the T stage is still T2. The N stage (lymph node involvement) is N2a, M stage (distant metastasis) is MX, and the overall stage is IIIA."
