However, since the tumor size is greater than 1 cm, it is further classified as T1c. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c."

According to the TNM staging system, a T1 tumor is 2 cm or less in size, and T1 is further divided into T1a (0.55 cm or less), T1b (more than 0.55 cm but not more than 1 cm), and T1c (more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1c."
