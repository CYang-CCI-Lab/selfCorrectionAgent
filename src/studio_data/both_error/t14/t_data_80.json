                "text": "The report mentions that the invasive component of the tumor has a maximum gross dimension of 5.8 cm. Based on the rules provided, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and since this tumor is 5.8 cm, the T stage would be T3. However, the report also mentions that there is direct extension to the skin, which qualifies as a T4 tumor. However, the T stage is not affected by the number of lymph nodes involved or the presence of metastasis. Therefore, based solely on the size of the tumor, the T stage would be T3. But since there is also direct extension to the skin, the T stage would be T4. However, the report does not specify whether the skin extension is more than 5 cm from the nipple, which is necessary to determine if it is T4a or T4b. Without this information, I would recommend using the more severe T stage, which is T4. But to be safe, I would also recommend further investigation to determine if the skin extension is more than 5 cm from the nipple."

The specific T stage is determined by the largest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the largest dimension is 5.8 cm, which is greater than 5.0 cm, but it is less than 5.1 cm, so the T stage is T2."
