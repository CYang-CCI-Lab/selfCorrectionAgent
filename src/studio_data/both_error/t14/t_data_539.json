The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and the type of carcinoma does not affect the T stage. The report clearly states the tumor size and the T stage, which is consistent with the provided information. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

In this pathology report, it is stated that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a single mass with the greatest dimension of 7.2 cm. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, a tumor size of greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is classified as T2. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
