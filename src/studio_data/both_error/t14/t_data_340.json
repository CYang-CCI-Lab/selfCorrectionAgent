In this report, the tumor is described as 'a product of modified radical mastectomy, breast measuring 16.0 x 11.5 x 5.0 cm with attached axillary tissue, measuring 7.9 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm with tags attached labeled one and two.' A 6.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm tumor is located in the central quadrant, about 1.5 cm beneath the overlying skin and 0.2 cm from the deep resection margin. Therefore, the tumor size is greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The T stage is not affected by the presence of metastasis in the sentinel lymph node or the number of positive lymph nodes."
