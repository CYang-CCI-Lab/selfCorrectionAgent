The size of the aggregate of yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue from this site is 1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. In the TNM staging system for cancer, the T stage is determined by the size of the primary tumor. T1 stage indicates a tumor size of 2 cm or less. Since the size of the tumor in this case is 0.6 cm (the largest dimension given), it falls within the T1 category."
