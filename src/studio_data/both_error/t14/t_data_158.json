Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

This falls within the T2 category for T stage in cancer staging. The report also mentions that the tumor is 'within 1 mm of the deep margin', but this does not affect the T stage. The absence of lymphatic invasion is also not a factor in determining the T stage."
