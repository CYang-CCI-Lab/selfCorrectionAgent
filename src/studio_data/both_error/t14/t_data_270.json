The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by the in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, so the T stage is still T2. The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, regardless of the type of carcinoma, so the T stage for this report is T2."

In this report, the primary tumor is described as a 'stony hard white-tan tumor measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm.' According to the TNM staging system for cancer, a T2 stage tumor is defined as a tumor that is 2.0 to 5.0 cm in size. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
