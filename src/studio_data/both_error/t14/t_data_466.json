According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, and T3 tumors are more than 5 cm. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

In this report, the primary tumor in the left breast is described as a 'firm, white, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm, located within the upper outer quadrant at the two o'clock aspect, 1.2 cm from the deep margin.' This indicates that the tumor is larger than 1 cm but not larger than 2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2."
