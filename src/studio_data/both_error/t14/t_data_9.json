The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, which is the infiltrating ductal carcinoma (1.7 cm). According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, and T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Since the largest tumor is 1.7 cm, it falls under the T1 category. More specifically, it is a T1c tumor as it is more than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in size."

The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor. In this case, the largest tumor is the infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a size of 1.7 cm, which falls under the T1 category. Specifically, it is a T1c tumor as it is between 1.0 and 2.0 cm in size. The other tumor, the infiltrating lobular carcinoma, is also a T1c tumor, but it is not the largest one. Therefore, the pathologic T stage for this patient's cancer is T1c."
