Based on the rules provided, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and this tumor is exactly 5 cm in the largest dimension. However, the report also mentions that there is no extension through the deep margin grossly. Therefore, the tumor does not meet the criteria for a T3 tumor, and we must consider the other T stage categories. Since the tumor is between 2 cm and 5 cm in size, it falls into the T2 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or the percentage of the tumor occupied by in situ component does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."

The T stage for breast cancer is based on the largest dimension of the tumor. In this case, the largest dimension is 5 cm, which falls within the T2 category (tumor size 2-5 cm). Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
