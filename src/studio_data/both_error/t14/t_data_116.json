Additionally, the report states that the tumor invades the dermal skin, which is a characteristic of T4 tumors. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T4."

According to the TNM staging system, a T4 stage is assigned to a tumor that is greater than 5 cm in size. However, in this case, the report indicates that the tumor invades the dermal skin (T4b), making the T stage T4."
