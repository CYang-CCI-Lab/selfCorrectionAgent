                "text": "The report mentions a 'bifocal cancer of the left breast' and provides a tumor size for one of the foci: 'visual area diameter: 0,55 mm'. However, this size is not in the format of the T stage rules provided, which are based on the largest tumor size in centimeters. Therefore, we need to convert the given measurement to centimeters. Since 1 centimeter is equal to 10 millimeters, the tumor size is 0.55 mm / 10 = 0.055 cm. This size falls within the T2 category, which includes tumors with a size of more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. Therefore, the predicted T stage for this patient is T2."

                "text": "The report mentions 'carcinoma ductale bifocale invasivum' which indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension but has not spread to the chest wall or skin. This corresponds to T2 stage. The bifocal nature of the tumor does not affect the T stage, as only the size of the largest tumor nodule is considered for T stage determination."
