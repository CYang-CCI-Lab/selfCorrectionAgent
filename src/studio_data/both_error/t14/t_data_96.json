The report does not mention the size of the tumor directly, but it does mention that the stage is 1c. According to the rules provided, the T stage is not affected by the N or M stage. In addition, the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma is based on the largest tumor size. Since the report does not indicate a tumor size greater than 2 cm, and there is no mention of T3 or T4, the T stage is most likely T1. This is also consistent with the stage 1c classification, as T1N1aM0 corresponds to stage 1c."

According to the pathology report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is a type of invasive breast cancer. The report also mentions that the tumor size is not greater than 2 cm, but it does not provide a specific measurement. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1."
