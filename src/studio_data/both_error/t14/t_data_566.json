According to the rules provided, T1 tumors are 2 cm or less in size, T2 tumors are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, T3 tumors are more than 5 cm, and T4 tumors are of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, the T stage is T2."

In this report, the size of the tumor is stated as 'SIZE OF TUMOR: Maximum dimension invasive component: 27 mm.' This converts to 2.7 cm. According to the TNM staging system, a T stage 2 cancer is defined as a tumor with a size of 2-5 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T2."
