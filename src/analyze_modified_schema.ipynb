FOCAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, WITH SQUAMOID. MORPHOLOGY, SOLID TYPE WITH INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE AND MINIMAL NECROSIS,. IS PRESENT ADJACENT TO BIOPSY CAVITY. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, CLASSICAL TYPE (TYPE. A). - THE NIPPLE BASE IS INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA. - CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN BENIGN BREAST PARENCHYMA. - NO VASCULAR INVASION IS NOTED. - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS. IDENTIFIED. - THE SKIN SHOWS AN ULCER. THE ATTACHED SKELETAL MUSCLE IS UNINVOLVED BY CARCINOMA. - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES. - FOUR BENIGN INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODES (0/4). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF. THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED. THIS REPORT. Gross Description: MD. M.D. 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, \"right breast\" and consists of. a. breast without attached axillary tail. The breast measures 30.5 x 17.5. x. 7.5 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 30.5 x 8 cm. The nipple. measures 1.2 x 1.2 x 1 cm and areola measures 5 x 5 cm. Two centimeters. above the nipple (upper inner quadrant), there is a well healed scar,. measuring 8 cm. A skin defect and ulceration is identified in the axillary. area, measuring 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The skin is slightly red, suggestive of a. possible surgical draining site. At the posterior aspect of the specimen,. there is a fibrotic area, measuring 6.5 x 3.5 cm. A suture demarcates the. axilla. The posterior surface of the breast is inked blue. Serial. sectioning of the specimen reveals a biopsy cavity under the scar, measuring. 4. x 4 cm. The biopsy cavity is about 0.3 cm from the posterior inked margin. The cavity is lined by hemorrhagic fibrotic tissue with bright yellow, fat. necrosis. No gross nodule is identified. Under the skin defect, there is a. hemorrhagic area, measuring 1 x 0.4 cm. This area is very close to the. posterior fibrosis. Sectioning the rest of the breast reveals a fatty cut. surface. A few intramammary lymph nodes are identified. Representative. sections are submitted. Summary of sections: N - nipple. NB - nipple base. S - skin with scar. SD -skin defect. F -posterior fibrotic area. D - deep margin. Bx -biopsy cavity. L -lesion under the skin defect. UIQ - upper inner quadrant. LIQ - lower inner quadrant. UOQ - upper outer quadrant. LOQ - lower outer quadrantLN - intramammary lymph nodes, entirely submitted. Summary of Sections: Part 1: SP: Right breast. Block. Sect. Site. PCs. 12. BX. 12. 1. D. 1. 1. F. 1. 2. L. 2. 2.

Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,. HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. ). Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines with mign, low and regative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this. patient\\'s sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer\\'s instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

SPECIMEN(S) SUBMITTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1. Pectoralis muscle: Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a single segment of skeletal muscle with attached. fibroadipose tissue and soft tissue measuring 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is unoriented. One surface is inked black. and the opposite surface is inked orange. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section. diagnosis in three cassettes. The frozen section remnant is submitted in cassettes A - C. 2. Right breast: In formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number is a 2374-gram, 26 x 18 x 11 cm. right simple mastectomy surfaced by brown skin. The specimen is oriented with a short stitch designated as superior and. a long stitch as lateral. The skin surface displays a 19 x 15.5 cm nodular gray-yellow mass involving the entire nipple. areolar complex. The nipple is not definitively identified. The mass comes to within 1.5 cm of the inferior skin margin, 2.5. cm of the superior skin margin, 1.8 cm of the lateral skin tip, and 8 cm of the medial skin tip. The superior skin margin is. inked blue, the inferior skin margin is inked green, and the deep margin is inked black. Upon sectioning the mass. involves all four quadrants and approaches the deep margin. Red-brown muscle is identified at the deep margin, which. also appears to be involved by tumor grossly. The cut surface of the mass is pink-gray to tan-yellow, firm, and glistening. The mass occupies approximately 80% of the breast parenchyma. The remaining cut surface displays yellow adipose. tissue intermixed with dense tan-white fibroglandular tissue. Representative sections are submitted in nine cassettes as. follows: A - B - superior skin margin, C D - the inferior margin, E - F - mass to include the deep margin, G - the deep. margin to include muscle, H - I the mass to include skin involvement.

NOTE: Cytokeratin AE1/3 stains were performed on A1 and A4 and is negative in A1 and positive in A4, highlighting. scattered tumor cells. On the cytokeratin AE1/3 stain, - 100 cytokeratin positive cells are seen, a feature that would. be consistent with isolated tumor cells versus a micrometastasis. The touch prep of A4 was reviewed and tumor cells. were not seen. B. BREAST, RIGHT NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2. TUMOR MEASURES AT LEAST 3.5 CM. - TUMOR IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN. - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) AND COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE. - ONE INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1). - SKELETAL MUSCLE, NO TUMOR SEEN. NOTE: Grossly, several lesions were noted that microscopically correspond to invasive carcinoma. The size of the. tumor is difficult to determine. While the single largest focus of tumor grossly is 3.5 cm, microscopically, invasive. carcinoma is present in 6 of 11 slices of a 12.5 cm specimen and therefore may span - 6 cm.

The specimen is received fresh labeled, \"Left total mastectomy, suture. marks axillary aspect\" and consists of a previously incised, 24.1 x 19.5 x. 4.6 cm breast with a partially overlying, 11.7 x 3.5 x 0.1 cm skin ellipse. Situated centrally on the skin surface is a 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.1 cm, crusty,. partially inverted, diffusely indurated, nipple with smooth, pink-white. suspicious cut surfaces surrounded by a 4.7 x 3.4 cm areola. The wrinkled,. tan-white skin is free of any gross abnormalities. A suture demarcates the. 7.2 x 4.6 x 0.5 cm axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is. inked black, the anterior blue and the axillary aspect is inked yellow. The. specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8 x 2.4 x 2.1 cm, firm, lobular. to fatty infiltrating bordered, pink-white mass, located in the lower inner. and outer quadrants, from 5 \\'\\'clock to 7 o\\'clock, underlying the nipple, 0.5. cm from the nipple base and 3.6 cm from the deep margin, (designated Mass. #1) The mass grossly appears to be separate from the suspicious indurated. nipple. Also, 5.9 cm superior and 1.5 cm medial to Mass #1, is a 2.5 x 2.2. x 1.3 cm, biopsy site partially surrounded by moderately dense, focally;. cystic, nodular and hemorrhagic, white fibrous tissue, located within the. apper outer quadrant, at 1 o\\'clock, 5.1 cm the nipple and 3.2 cm from the. deep margin, (designated Biopsy site #1) In addition, partially abutting. biopsy site #1 is a twist-clip situated within a 2.6 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm. well-healed biopsy site with a peripherally attached 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm,. ovoid, firm, smooth to nodular bordered, white to indigo blue ink-tinged. mass, located within the upper outer quadrant, at 2 o\\'clock, 5.5 cm from the. nipple and 4.2 cm the deep margin (designated Biopay site #2 and Mass #2). The remaining breast parenchyma consists of lobules of yellow adipose. separated by bands of mild to moderately dense, focally nodular and cystic,. white fibrous tissue. Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grosalv. identifiable lymph nodes. TPS is submitted of Mass #1, per protocol. Representative sections are submitted.

B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the -. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu. /CEP17. Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.
