The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen.

(0: 100%; 1+: 0%; 2+: 08; 3+:0%). ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS (ER/PR) TEST DETAILS: Using formalin fixed tissues (8-96 hours) and appropriate. positive and negative internal/external controls; the test for the presence of hormone receptor protein is performed by the. immunoperoxidase method according to the ASCO-CAP Guidelines. A positive Estrogen or Progesterane receptor tumor shows. nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to 1% of the tumor cells (i.e. and H-score of 1 or higher). The ER and PR. Histologic Score (H-Score, or HS) is calculated as the sum of intensity of staining times the proportion of cells staining and has a. dynamic range of 0 to 300. The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calculate the H-score is also shown above in. the report. Generally, the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According to. the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H-score of 251 (>75% cells staining); H-. score of 130 (51-75% cells staining); H-score of 42 (10-50% cells staining); H-score of 4 (<10% cells staining).

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3. PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dako. blowing the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.
