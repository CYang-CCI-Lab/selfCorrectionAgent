DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS IN THIS CASK: Invasive ductal carcinoma present as two foci spaning 28 mm and 2 mm and is. 3.6 cm from the closest inked margin. The nipple dermis is involved by invasive ductal carcinoma. Mucinous carcinoma spans 2.5 mm and does not involve the inked margin. All foci of invasive carcinoma (ductal and mucinous) are ER positive, HER2. negative. DCIS is present and is 3.6 cm from the closest inked margin. Sentinel lymph nodes: 2/3. Non-sentinel lymph nodes: 1/1. Total lymph nodes: 3/4. Type of metastasis: macrometastasis (6 mm) to an intramammary lymph node. 1. SENTINEL NODE #1, LEVEL ONE LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION: Sentinel Lymph Node Status: Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 1. Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with carcinoma: 1. Size of Largest Metastatic Focus: >= 0.2 mm to =< 2 mm (micrometastasis). The metastatic focus spans 0.4 mm. Level of Detection: Initial H&E stained section. Extracapsular Extension: Not present. 2. SENTINEL NODE #2, LEVEL ONE LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION: Sentinel Lymph Node Status: Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 1. Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with carcinoma: 1. Size of Largest Metastatic Focus: > 2 nm. The metastatic focus spans 3 mm. Level of Detection: Initial H&E stained section. Extracapsular Extension: Present, measuring < 2mm in largest diameter. The metastatic carcinoma is negative for WT1. 3. Non-sentinel node, left axilla, excision: - One benign lymph node (0/1). 4. BREAST, LEFT, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY: Invasive Carcinoma: Ductal, NOS type. Focal mucinous carcinoma (see note). Histologic Grade: III/III: Minimal or no tubule formation K< 10% of tumor). Nuclear Grade: III/III (marked variation in size and shape). Tumor Size: Two foci (size specified below). the invasive ductal carcinoma spans 28 mm and 2 mm. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) : Present. DCIS, Architecture: Solid. Papillary. DCIS Nuclear Grade: High. Necrosis in DCIS: Minimal. Extensive intraductal component (>25% of tumor mass) : Not Identified. Lobular Neoplasia: Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) classical type. Location of Invasive Carcinoma: Upper inner quadrant (UIQ). Lower inner quadrant (LIQ). Location of DCIS: Upper inner quadrant (UIQ). Lower inner quadrant (LIQ). Nipple Involvement: Invasive carcinoma involves the nipple stroma. Skin: Tumor emboli are present in dermal lymphatic channels. The examined skin margins are uninvolved by carcinoma. Calcification: In benign breast tissue. In invasive carcinoma. Lymphovascular Invasion: Present. Surgical Margins: Invasive carcinoma is 36 mm from the closest margin. DCIS is 36 mm from the closest margin. Benign Breast Tissue: Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). Fibrocystic changes, including apocrine metaplasia, cyst formation. and stromal fibrosis. Biopsy site changes. Columnar cell changes. Lymph Nodes: LN - Number of lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma: 1. Number of lymph nodes examined: 1. The mass identified in the UOQ at 1:00 is an intramammary lymph. node, almost enrtirely replaced by metastaic carcinoma. The metastaic. carcinoma measures 0.6 cm and is negative for WT1. Results of immunostains. for calponin and p63 support the diagnosis. A 2.5 mm focus of invasive mucinous carcinoma is also identified, with. nuclear grade II/III. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed tissue with the. following results for. INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA (block 4-5) : ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (6F11,. 90% nuclear staining with strong. intensity. PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (1E2;. negative (no nuclear staining). HER2 (4B5,. Negative (0 / 1+). The invasive ductal carcinoma is negative for WT1. The smaller focus of invasive ductal carcinoma has similar immunoprofile. Positive membranous imunoreactivity for E-cadherin supports ductal. differentiation. MUCINOUS CARCINOMA (block 4-19) : ESTROGEN RECEPTOR. 95% nuclear staining with strong. intensity. PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (. 95% nuclear staining with strong. intensity. HER2 (. Negative (0). The mucinous carcinoma is positive for WT1. Comment: Controls are satisfactory. PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is. an 7DA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 4B5) directed. against the internal domain of the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein (HER2) for. immunohistochemical detection of HER2 protein overexpression in breast. cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HER2 test. results are reported in accordance with the ASCO/CAP guideline. recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007;. 6(1):118-145). The ER and PR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA. approved. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF.

The specimen is a 22.7 x 11.5. x. 2.5 cm mastectomy specimen. The overlying skin ellipse measures 17.0 x 11.0. cm, and includes a 5.5 cm areola and 1.0 cm nipple. A well-healed 3.0 cm scar. is noted just superior to the areola in the upper inner quadrant. The. specimen includes an axillary tail which measures 11.0 cm x 7.0 cm. The. margins of the specimen are inked in blue, and the specimen is serially. sectioned to reveal a 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm tumor in the upper inner quadrant,. extending medially to the upper outer quadrant. The tumor is firm,. tannish-white, with a gritty consistency. It appears to be infiltrating. adjacent tissue. Tissue has been sent for estrogen and progesterone receptor. assays. The tumor approaches to 1 cm of the deep margin. It approaches to. 1.0 cm to the lateral margins. The remainder of the breast tissue is composed. of lobular adipose tissue intermixed with reddish pink fibrous tissue. There. is an area of dense white fibrous breast tissue in the upper outer quadrant. The axillary tail measures 13.5 x 8.0 cm. It is composed of yellow lobular. adipose tissue. Several nodes are identified grossly. A 3.1 x 1.0 cm node is. sectioned to reveal a firm 2.0 x 1.0 cm tan-white mass. The axillary tail is. amputated, divided into three sections and searched for lymph nodes which are. submitted as described below. Block Summary: A1- section of skin through nipple and areola.
