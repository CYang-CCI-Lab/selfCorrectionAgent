The posterior surface of the breast is. inked black and the anterior blue. Part of the posterior surface of the. breast is covered by dark red skeletal muscle, measuring 11 x 4 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular tumor bed (10 x. 8.3 x 5.1 cm) with poorly defined white, firm and tan areas. The tumor bed. occupies almost the entire breast volume, extending throughout all four. quadrants. The tumor bed is located 0.2 cm from the posterior margin, 0.3 cm. from the anterior margin, and 0.5 cm from the skeletal muscle. The remaining. breast tissue shows yellow fatty areas with foci of fibrosis. The axillary. tissue is dissected to reveal 13 possible lymph nodes, ranging in size from. 0.4 cm to 1.2 cm.

Entire report and diagnosis completed by. COMMENT. Although the tumor has central sclerosis, this comprises less than 30% of the tumor (so the. tumor does not qualify as the subtype of invasive carcinomas with a ""large central acellular zone""). Although tumor approached the anterior margin in the initial segmental mastectomy specimen,. this tissue was re-excised and found to be free of tumor, so tumor does not approach the final. surgical margins. Tumor is 5 mm from nearest deep margin. Tumor marker studies were reported previously (see. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (A) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - An oriented segmental mastectomy specimen (5.5 x. 5.1 x 3.3 cm). Nine slices are cut from superior to inferior, and a specimen radiograph is obtained.
