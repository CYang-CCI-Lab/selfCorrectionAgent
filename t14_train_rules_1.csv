(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

It consists. of a 2.9 X 2.2 X 0.7 cm discoid lobulated portion of fatty tissue. On dissection a single 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. lymph node is recovered. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the. specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Medially and. inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The. breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area. of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral,. 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep. The fibrous tissue is separated from. the deep margin by a thin layer of movable fascial tissue. The fibrous breast parenchyma is 3 cm from the. Pathology Consultation Report.

It is 1 cm from the closest skin and abuts the fascial margin of the posterior breast centrally. Representative samples of this tissue are obtained for research purposes. Sections of this fibrous breast. tissue reveal a central and inferiorly located area of hemorrhage with a twisted biopsy site clip. The. remainder of the breast is composed predominantly of fatty tissue but rubbery fibrous parenchyma extends. to the lower-outer quadrant. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the tail of the breast.

This is a breast. with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin measures 24 x 15 cm. The. skin and nipple are unremarkable. The breast measures 24 x 15 x 4 cm. A suture tags the. axillary tail which measures 5 x 3 x 3 cm. The chest wall margin is fatty and. unremarkable. This margin is marked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned. The breast tissue is mostly fatty without focal suspicious lesions. A couple of large. fatty lymph nodes are found in the axillary tail with the largest one measuring 3 cm in. greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1. nipple. A2-5 -. representative breast tissue moving medial to lateral. A6 -. chest wall margin, inked. RUN DATE: RUN TIME: RUN USER: SPEC #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued). A7. axillary tail. A8. one fatty lymph node. A9-11-. largest fatty lymph node. Specimen B is received in the fresh state labeled ""right modified radical mastectomy"". This is a breast with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin ellipse. measures 20 x. 15 cm. The breast measures 20 x 15 x 4 cm. The axillary tail measures 8 x 8. x. 3. cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The chest all margin is fatty without focal. lesions. The chest wall margin is inked black. There is some palpable nodularity along. the medial most margin and this margin is inked blue, Serial sections through the breast. reveal mostly fatty tissue with irregular areas of white fibrosis. In the central breast. roughly 3 cm inferior to the nipple is an ill-defined, indurated area suspicious for tumor. and associated with fresh hemorrhage. This area spans approximately 1 cm by palpation and. a portion of this area is submitted for tumor banking, handed off to. There. appears. to. be. a. separate tumorous area in the lateral breast roughly 6 cm from the nipple. and spanning by palpation roughly 3 cm. Again, this area is visually ill-defined. There. may be yet a third .11-defined indurated area in the far lateral breast spanning. approximately 7 mm. Several fatty lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail. These. measure up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: B1,2 -. nodularity in the medial most breast. B3. nipple. B4. grossly uninvolved medial breast tissue. B5-7 -. 1 cm nodule mid inferior breast. B8 -. hemorrhagic focus mid breast. B9. chest wall margin central breast.

B19,20-. multiple lymph nodes. NOTE: The specimen margins were grossly uninvolved by tumorous tissue by at least 1 cm. along the deep margin. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The slides are examined and evaluated. E-cadherin stain is performed on the left breast. tissue in an area showing features of lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular. hyperplasia. The E. Cadherin stain is negative confirming this diagnosis. In addition to. the histologic sections one of the lymph node from the right modified radical mastectomy is. examined with Pankeratin stain.
