TCGA-A2-A0YH.0C344CD7-6FAB-462B-9A8E-75B720F2D626,1,T1c,"[Step 1: Identify the size of the tumor] The report states that the size of the tumor is 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm in greatest dimensions. <br>[Step 2: Compare the size of the tumor to the T stage criteria] The tumor size is within the T1 range, which includes invasive breast carcinomas that are 2 cm or less in size. However, the T1 category can be further divided into T1mi, T1a, T1b, and T1c based on the size of the tumor. <br>[Step 3: Determine the appropriate T1 subcategory] The tumor size is greater than 0.1 cm but less than 2 cm. Therefore, the tumor falls into the T1c category, which includes invasive breast carcinomas that are 1 cm but less than 2 cm in size. <br>[Step 4: Confirm the absence of T3 and T4 criteria] The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, nor does it mention any ulceration, satellite nodules, or inflammatory carcinoma. Therefore, the tumor does not meet the criteria for T3 or T4. <br>[Step 5: Confirm the absence of multifocal or multicentric disease] The report does not mention any multifocal or multicentric disease. Therefore, the tumor is considered unifocal. <br>[Step 6: Confirm the absence of Tis (carcinoma in situ) or Tis (Paget's disease) as the only tumor] The report mentions the presence of duct carcinoma in situ (Tis) adjacent to the invasive tumor, but it is not the only tumor present. Therefore, the tumor is not considered Tis or Tis (Paget's disease) only. <br>[Step 7: Confirm the absence of inflammatory carcinoma] The report does not mention any signs of inflammatory carcinoma. Therefore, the tumor is not considered T4d. <br>[Step 8: Assign the final T stage] Based on the above reasoning, the final T stage for this patient's breast cancer is T1c.","Chief of. CPNSU.

TCGA-A2-A0YT.1C420F6B-8720-4CB0-9FB3-86A0EC05FBBD,3,T3,"Based on the pathology report, the patient's breast cancer is described as an 'infiltrative duct carcinoma' with a 'confluent region that measures 13.6 cm.' This indicates that the tumor is larger than 5 cm, which rules out T1 and T2 stages.  The report also mentions 'focal extension of the tumor into the epidermis without ulceration' and 'a satellite nodule' in the skin. These findings correspond to T4b and T4c stages, respectively. However, the report also states that 'the inked margins are free' which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding skin beyond the margin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the patient's breast cancer is most likely to be in T3 stage, as it is larger than 5 cm but has not invaded the chest wall or caused skin ulceration or satellite nodules beyond the margin. However, it is important to note that the actual T stage should be determined by a healthcare professional based on a variety of factors, including clinical examination, imaging studies, and pathological findings.","SURGICAL REPORT.

Ink code: blue = superior superficial, green = inferior. superficial, black = posterior. The skin is notable for a 2.0 cm well. healed scar near the lateral edge of the ellipse. Examination of the. axilla reveals multiple firm lymph nodes. A seperate mass is present in. the upper outer quadrant measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm. The breast is then serially sectioned revealing extensive white fibrous. tissue with a 1.2 cm multiloculated biopsy cavity with associated. hemorrhage and fat necrosis in the lower outer quadrant . Sections of the tumor mass and skin and breast samples for. protocol with matching paraffin sections are follows: cassette A1 grossly. normal skin (medial tip). cassettes A2 and A3 2.0 cm tumor mass from upper. outer quadrant, cassette A4 1.7 cm lymph node, high axilla (grossly. positive), cassette A5 1.8 cm grossly normal lymph node, high axilla,. cassette A6 biopsy cavity site, lower outer quadrant, cassette A7 grossly. normal fibrous tissue, lower outer quadrant (approximately 2.0 cm from. biopsy cavity) cassette A8 grossly normal fibrous tissue, upper outer. quadrant, cassette A9 grossly normal fibrous tissue upper inner quadrant,. cassette A10 grossly normal fibrous tissue lower inner quadrant, cassette.

The left mastectomy (Part C) showed no evidence of malignancy, and the lymph nodes are discussed in the context of N stage, not T stage.""T1"": This stage includes invasive breast carcinomas that are 2 cm or less in size. There is no mention of any tumor size in Part D being 2 cm or less, so the T1 stage is not applicable.""T2"": This stage includes invasive breast carcinomas that are more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. The report states that there is a 'gray-tan mass at 9 o'clock which measures 5.5 cm from medial to lateral, 8 cm from superior to inferior by palpation, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior.' This mass is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, so the T stage is T2."",""T3"": This stage includes invasive breast carcinomas that are more than 5 cm in size or tumors of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report does not mention any tumor size larger than 5 cm, and there is no explicit mention of direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T3 stage is not applicable."",""T4"": This stage includes invasive breast carcinomas that have spread to the chest wall and/or the skin, resulting in ulceration (T4b) or satellite nodules (T4c), or inflammatory carcinoma (T4d). The report does not mention any ulceration, satellite nodules, or inflammatory carcinoma. However, it does mention that the 'axillary portion measures 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm' and that there is a 'prominent structure... a 3.8 cm in greatest dimension grossly positive lymph node.' These findings suggest that the tumor has extended to the axillary tissue, which is part of the chest wall. However, the report does not explicitly state that the tumor has invaded the chest wall, so the T4 stage is not definitively applicable."",""conclusion"": ""Based on the information provided in the pathology report and the rules for determining the T stage, the patient's breast cancer is most likely T2. The tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. However, there is some ambiguity regarding the T4 stage, as the report suggests that the tumor has extended to the chest wall, but it does not explicitly state that the tumor has invaded the chest wall.

This measurement indicates that the invasive tumor is less than 3 cm in size in its greatest dimension. \\n2. According to the rules provided, T1 includes invasive breast carcinomas that are 2 cm or less in size. Since the tumor in this case is less than 3 cm, it falls under T1. \\n3. To further classify the T1 stage, we need to consider the size more precisely. The report mentions that the tumor measures 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The largest dimension is 3 cm, which is still within the T1 category. \\n4. However, the rules further divide T1 into T1mi, T1a, T1b, and T1c, based on the size of the tumor.

(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.
