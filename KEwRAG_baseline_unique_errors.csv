Non-sentinel lymph node #2, biopsy: No tumor in one (0/1). Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1. (lymph node). The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

The specimen is composed. largely of yellow, lobulated, glistening adipose tissue admixed with white. fibrous areas. The specimen will be inked and oriented as follows: Black=deep, yellow=anterior, blue=medial, green=lateral, and red denotes. superficial and inferior. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior. to inferior revealing a fiarly well-defined, grey/tan nodule, 1.5 cm in. greatest dimension, abutting the anterior margin in the mid portion of the. specimen. Immediately adjacent to this nodule is a 1.5 cm patch of. indurated fibrous tissue involving the anterior and medial margins. The. remaining tissue consists of an admixture of fibrous tissue (approximately. 40%) and fat (approximately 60%) . The fibrous tissue is variably. indurated, particularly in the inferior half of the specimen. Sections of. nodule and fibrous tissue are harvested for the CBCP protocol. Matching. paraffin sections are as follows: A1: Nodule. A2: Indurated fibrous tissue adjacent to A1. A3: Fibrous tissue 3.0 cm inferior to nodule. A4: Fibrous tissue 6.0 cm inferior to nodule at the inferior margin. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and submitted from. superior to inferior as follows: A5-A12: Representative section from each level from superior to inferior.

The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue. According to the report, the patient had multiple masses with the largest one measuring 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. This is how we interpret the relevant information: \\n1. The report mentions that the tumor is invasive mammary carcinoma and forms multiple masses, with the largest one measuring 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. This indicates that the tumor is greater than 1 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. \\n2. The report also mentions that the tumor closely approaches the original inferior margin (0.1 cm). However, this does not change the T stage as per the AJCC guidelines. \\n3. The report also mentions that there is no angiolymphatic invasion identified. \\nBased on the above information, the patient's breast cancer falls under T2 category, which is defined as a tumor that is greater than 1 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. Therefore, the final decision regarding the T stage is T2.","Final diagnosis. Breast. right, simple mastectomy: Invasive mammary carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III),. with predominantly lobular features is identified forming multiple (4) masses (ranging in size. from 0.7 cm to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension) (AJCC pTc) situated in multiple quadrants (lower. inner quadrant, inferior central, upper outer quadrant, and 12 o' clock position). There is a. minimal (5%) component of ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade. No. angiolymphatic invasion identified. Tumor closely approaches (0.1 cm) the original inferior. margin. Skin, nipple, and final surgical margins (after re-excision) are negative for tumor. Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (5) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes. are negative for tumor (AJCCpN0(sn)(i-)). Blue dye is identified in all five right axillary sentinel. lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded. sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression.

The T stage is based on the size of the primary tumor and whether it has invaded the chest wall or skin.  \n1. From the report, we can see that there are two separate breast masses: one is 5.3 x 2.7 x 1.4 cm and the other is 1.2 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  \n2. According to the AJCC's TNM Staging System, a T1 stage is defined as a tumor that is 2.0 cm or less in size. Since both of these tumors are larger than 2.0 cm, they do not meet the criteria for a T1 stage.  \n3. A T2 stage is defined as a tumor that is larger than 2.0 cm but not larger than 5.0 cm. The larger tumor (5.3 x 2.7 x 1.4 cm) meets this criterion, but the smaller tumor (1.2 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) does not.  \n4. A T3 stage is defined as a tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin. However, the report states that there is no evidence of chest wall or skin invasion.  \n5. A T4 stage is defined as a tumor of any size with either inflammatory carcinoma or direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Again, the report states that there is no evidence of chest wall or skin invasion, and there is no mention of inflammatory carcinoma.  \\6. Therefore, based on the size of the larger tumor (5.3 x 2.7 x 1.4 cm), the patient's breast cancer is classified as a T2 stage according to the AJCC's TNM Staging System.","Final Diagnosis.

This is because the invasive tumor measures approximately 2.0 cm in largest dimension, which falls within the T2 category (2.0-5.0 cm).

From the macroscopic description, we know that there are two tumors with sizes 1.8 cm and 1.2 cm. We take the larger size for T staging, so T = 1.8 cm. \n2. The report mentions that 'margins of resection are free of infiltrating tumor', but 'ductal carcinoma in situ extends to involve inked anterior margin and infiltrating tumor extends to within 0.3 cm of the anterior margin'. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not considered in T staging, so we focus on the infiltrating tumor. The tumor extends to within 0.3 cm of the anterior margin, but it doesn't invade the margin. \\n3. There's no mention of invasion into the skin (T4) or the chest wall (T3), or of inflammatory breast carcinoma (T4d). \\n4. Based on these findings, the patient's pathologic T stage is T2, as the largest tumor size is between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm (2.0 cm > 1.8 cm) and it hasn't invaded the skin or chest wall.","FATIENI MISTURT: DATE of LMP: DATE OF LAST DELIVERY: PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: LEFT BREAST CANCER.

The report mentions three invasive lobular carcinoma masses with maximum dimensions of 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm. The largest mass measures 2.0 cm. Therefore, the patient's T stage is T2. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Identify the largest tumor size: The report states that there are three invasive lobular carcinoma masses with maximum dimensions of 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm. The largest mass is 2.0 cm. 2. Compare the tumor size with AJCC's TNM Staging System: According to the AJCC's TNM Staging System, T2 indicates a tumor size of 2.0-5.0 cm. Since the largest mass in this patient is 2.0 cm, the T stage is T2. The presence of perineural invasion, close margins, and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based solely on the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the patient's T stage is T2.  \\  }","DIAGNOSIS.
