Diagnosis: LEFT BREAST, MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY: - Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. - Tumor size: 2.7 cm in diameter. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high nuclear grade, solid type,. present at periphery of invasive carcinoma. - No comedo necrosis or calcifications present. - DCIS comprises less than 10% of tumor volume. - Mastectomy margins are free of tumor. - Carcinoma is at least 1.5 cm from the superior-superficial margin,. and is at least 2 cm from all other margins. - Ten axillary lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/10). - Papilloma, inferior-central breast, measuring at least 0.9 cm in diameter. - Fibroadenoma, 0.8 cm, lower outer quadrant. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. Type and grade (in situ): DCIS, high nuclear grade. Primary tumor: pT2. Regional lymph nodes: pNO. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Pathologic stage: IIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. Margin status: Negative. COMMENT: The invasive carcinoma has features suggestive of the basal-like. phenotype. In support of this, the tumor was found to be positive for CK5/6 (previous. core needle biopsy). Although the tumor was not reported as ""triple negative"", the. estrogen receptor as only positive in 5% of tumor cells (biomarker studies performed. on previous core needle biopsy; see synoptic report for additional details).

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Malignant neoplasm of breast, left. Gross Description: Single specimen designated as left breast mastectomy, stitch is lateral, with axillary dissection. Initially. received in the fresh state for possible Oncogenotyping studies, is a 728 gram left modified radical. mastectomy, 31.8 cm medial to lateral (including axillary extension), 19,7 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm. posterior-anterior. The overlying ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin is 16.9 x 10.2 cm with a paracentral,. darkened brow areola, 3.8 cm in diameter and prominent nipple, 1.3 cm in diameter. A double black. suture marks the lateral apex of the skin. Included within the container is an unoriented, crescent-shaped. strip of wrinkled. tan-brown skin, 19.5 x 1.8 X 1.0 cm. The tentative outer edge of this skin - peripheral. margin is marked blue and the remaining surgical margins are marked yellow. The surgical margins of the. mastectomy are differentially inked as follows: Superior superficial: Blue,. Inferior superficial: Orange,. Posterior; Black. The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the medial-lateral long axis (slab 1 assigned at. the base of the axillary extension of fat) to reveal a well-circumscribed, light tan, centrally softened tumor. mass measuring upwards of 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm (slabs 4-6, from lateral). The tumor is grossly placed 1.5 cm. from the superior superficial, 1.3 cm deep to the skin, 2.3 cm from the deep surgical margin, 3.5 cm from. the most lateral extension of breast (not including axillary extension), greater than 6.0 cm from the inferior. superficial surgical margin, and greater than 6.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast.

As noted. above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary. sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (verified by keratin immunostaining). Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and. No. 4. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1B, No. 1C, No. 1D,. No. 2B, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C. HER2/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation. guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor. nodules (using tissue blocks B2 and B4).

A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer.

Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft.

E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 6 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 3 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. D11. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.29. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered.

Auanionally labeled right sentinel node and contains a. 1.7 cm yellow tan fibrofatty soft tissue. The specimen is. bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section with the. residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section in. cassette A labeled. B. Additionally labeled left breast and contains a 641. gram, 20.0 x 13.5 x 7.0 cm simple mastectomy specimen. partially surfaced by a 17.5 x 9.3 cm ellipsé: of pink tan. wrinkled skin bearing a central 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm everted. nipple. No orientation is offered or possible. The deep. margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to. reveal a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm ill defined gray white gritty. mass that resides 3.5 cm from the skin surface and. approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep margin. Located immediately adjacent to this mass is a 3.5 x 2.8 x. 2.3 cm shaggy, necrotic cavity consistent with previous. biopsy site. This cavity resides 1.5 cm below the skin. surface and approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep. margin. The remainder of the cut surface is comprised of. predominantly yellow tan adipose tissue admixed with. moderate amounts of interspersed gray white fibrous tissue. No additional masses are identified. Also received in the same container is an 11.5 x 2.0 x 1.5. cm strip of pink tan wrinkled skin with adherent yellow tan. fibrofatty soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a yellow tan. fibrofatty cut surface with no discrete lesions. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B13. labeled. designated as follows: B1- nipple;. B2- inked deep margin, perpendicular; B3-B5-- mass; B6-B9--. previous biopsy cavity; B10-B12-- representative sections. from the three uninvolved quadrants; B13-- sections from. separately submitted skin and fibroadipose tissue.

INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS. Test. Description. Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report. Any negative Her2 IHC result. without optimal fixation time should have Her2 FISH testing. performed. FISH, HER2/neu refl to IHC: CYTOGENETIC RESULTSCylogenetic. Reference #: Test Setup Date: est.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

The grade of the tumor (1, 2, or 3) can also impact the stage, with higher grades being more likely to be in a higher stage.
Micrometastasis is considered positive lymph node involvement and corresponds to N1 stage.
Multiple matted lymph nodes with nearly complete architectural effacement by metastatic carcinoma correspond to N2 stage.
The presence of intraductal carcinoma in a lymph node corresponds to N1 stage.
Extranodal invasion indicates a more aggressive cancer behavior and is associated with a worse prognosis.
High-grade DCIS in the immediate tumor periphery suggests a higher stage than the absence of high-grade DCIS.
The AJCC staging system uses pT, pN, and pM categories to determine the overall stage of the cancer, where pT refers to the tumor, pN to the lymph nodes, and pM to distant metastasis.
Direct extension of tumor into the skin or dermis does not necessarily upstage the T category if the size remains within the same category.
No lymph node metastasis indicates N0 stage.
A negative ER/PR status is not a criterion for upstaging the cancer stage.
Extracapsular extension of tumor in lymph nodes is considered N2 stage.
If a sentinel node is positive, then a final 'N stage' can be assigned only after complete lymph node dissection.
If no sentinel node is found, the N stage is determined by the number of involved non-sentinel lymph nodes.
If no lymph nodes are examined, the N stage cannot be determined.
The presence of metastasis in one or more lymph nodes in level II corresponds to N2 stage.
No lymph node metastasis corresponds to N0 stage.
Metastasis in 4-9 lymph nodes corresponds to N2 stage.
The absence of lymph node metastasis corresponds to N0 stage.",28.0,2641.0,99.0,True
