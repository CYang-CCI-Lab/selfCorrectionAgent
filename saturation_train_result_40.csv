The specimen is received with an accompanying radiogram which shows a needle coursing from the. medial aspect to the lateral aspect. The needle is a stellate area of increased density and a surgical. clip is present. The specimen has been oriented in surgery with short designating superior long lateral. and looped anterior. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red, lateral-yellow,. anterior-blue, medial-green and posterior black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior. and in the inferior aspect of the specimen is an irregularly shaped firm pink-tan mass measuring. 3.7x3.5x1.5cm. Areas of hemorrhage are seen. The mass is within 1. 1cm from the lateral margin,. 1.2cm from the anterior margin, 2.2cm from the medial margin, 1.7cm from the deep margin, 1.7cm. from the inferior margin and approximately 4.4cm from the superior margin.

Gross examination of the left breast wide. local excision shows an irregularly shaped 3.7x3.5x1.5cm lesion, which is grossly away from the. margins of excision. On gross examination, there is a separate firm nodule which measures 0.7cm in. diameter which is near the larger tumor mass. Examination of microscopic sections, in the intervening. breast between these two nodules, however shows continuity of the 2nd smaller nodule with the larger. mass, consistent with an irregular, dumbbell shaped single lesion.

Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, and consists of three lymph. nodes with attached fat, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for. permanent microscopy as follows: 1A: two lymph nodes. 1B: one lymph node serially sectioned. Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary palpable lymph nodes, and consists of four lymph. nodes,. ranging from 0.8 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned to reveal predominantly pink-. tan. cut surfaces, one of which displays a white focus. A smear preparation from the lymph node with the white focus is performed. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for permanent microscopy as follows: 2A-D: one lymph node per cassette. Specimen#3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary lymph node, sentinel #2, and consists of one, 0.9. cm lymph node, which is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety labeled 3A. Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled left axillary sentinel lymph node #3, and consists of six lymph nodes ranging from 0.2. cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and the lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety as. follows: 4A: five lymph nodes. 4B: one lymph node, bisected. Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled left total mastectomy, suture in axillary tail, and consists of an 858 gm, 25 x 23 x 5 cm left. total mastectomy specimen, with a suture marking the axillary tail. There is a 24 x 17 cm, ovoid to elliptical portion of brown skin. on the anterior aspect, displaying a 2 X 2 X 1 cm everted nipple. The skin displays multiple brown-black, flat to raised,. predominantly keratotic skin lesions, ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.0 cm and 0.6 to 0.2 cm. The largest lesion is located at 12 o'clock,. 1.7 cm from the nearest 12 o'clock margins. One of the smaller lesions appears to be transected at the 5 d'clock margin. The. specimen is inked as follows: superoanterior - blue, inferoanterior - green, posterior - black. The posterior margin is intact. The. specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 1.6 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm tan-white, ovoid, lobulated, indurated mass located retroareolar, 6 cm. from the deep margin and 3 cm from the overlying skin. Sectioning of the mass reveals a clip. Anterior to the mass is some dense. fibrosis, displaying possible comedonecrosis. Sectioning of the remaining fibrous tissue reveals a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm rubbery,. but. stellate area of fibrosis at 1-2 o'clock, 11 cm from the nipple. Sectioning of this area reveals a clip. The clip is located 3 cm from. the. deep margin, and 6.5 cm from the overlying skin. No definitive gross tumor is associated with this clip. The remaining breast. parenchyma consists of approximately 90% yellow, lobulated adipose tissue, and 10% scattered white, rubbery fibrous tissue. A. small portion of tumor and normal are submitted for TCGA studies. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 5A: nipple. 5B-5D: mass with clip, no margin. 5E-5G: representative fibrous tissue anterior to mass, no margin. 5H: representative deep margin to mass. 5I-5K: stellate area of fibrosis with clip. 5L: posterior margin and anterior skin to stellate area of fibrosis with clip. 5M-50: representative fibrous tissue at 12-1 o'clock. 5P: representative upper inner quadrant. 5Q: representative lower inner quadrant. 5R: representative lower outer quadrant. 5S: representative upper outer quadrant. 5T: representative margin in second largest skin lesion. 5U: representative medium five skin lesions. 5V: representative smaller skin lesions.
