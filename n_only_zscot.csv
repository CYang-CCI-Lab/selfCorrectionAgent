Therefore, based on the given rules, the N stage for this patient would be N0, which indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.", Nx. The N stage is not provided in this report.," The N stage is not provided in this report. It typically refers to the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes.

What is the T stage from this report?
The T stage is T2 as an infiltrative neoplastic lesion (tumor) is present in the breast.

What is the M stage from this report?
The M stage is not provided in this report. It typically refers to the presence of distant metastasis.

What is the G stage from this report?
The G stage is II as the tumor shows moderate pleomorphism with nuclear hyperchromasia and few mitotic figures.

Therefore, based on the information provided in this report, the pathologic stage of the patient's cancer is T2, G2, Nx, M0 (T2NxM0)."

SPECIMEN(S) SUBMITTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1. Pectoralis muscle: Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a single segment of skeletal muscle with attached. fibroadipose tissue and soft tissue measuring 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is unoriented. One surface is inked black. and the opposite surface is inked orange. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section. diagnosis in three cassettes. The frozen section remnant is submitted in cassettes A - C. 2. Right breast: In formalin labeled with the patient's name and medical record number is a 2374-gram, 26 x 18 x 11 cm. right simple mastectomy surfaced by brown skin. The specimen is oriented with a short stitch designated as superior and. a long stitch as lateral. The skin surface displays a 19 x 15.5 cm nodular gray-yellow mass involving the entire nipple. areolar complex. The nipple is not definitively identified. The mass comes to within 1.5 cm of the inferior skin margin, 2.5. cm of the superior skin margin, 1.8 cm of the lateral skin tip, and 8 cm of the medial skin tip. The superior skin margin is. inked blue, the inferior skin margin is inked green, and the deep margin is inked black. Upon sectioning the mass. involves all four quadrants and approaches the deep margin. Red-brown muscle is identified at the deep margin, which. also appears to be involved by tumor grossly. The cut surface of the mass is pink-gray to tan-yellow, firm, and glistening. The mass occupies approximately 80% of the breast parenchyma. The remaining cut surface displays yellow adipose. tissue intermixed with dense tan-white fibroglandular tissue. Representative sections are submitted in nine cassettes as. follows: A - B - superior skin margin, C D - the inferior margin, E - F - mass to include the deep margin, G - the deep. margin to include muscle, H - I the mass to include skin involvement. The specimen is placed in formalin at. giving a total formalin fixation time of approximately 8.5 hours. INTRAOPERATIVE REPORT: 1.
