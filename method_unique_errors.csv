TCGA-D8-A1XU.845F8FCF-CF3C-4CEF-B673-A57DE626939C,0,T2,"The report mentions that the patient has a bifocal invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, with one of the foci having a visual area diameter of 0.55 mm. To determine the T stage, we need to consider the size of the largest focus of the tumor. In this case, the size of the largest focus is not explicitly stated in the report, but it can be estimated. The diameter of 0.55 mm mentioned in the report is for one of the foci, and since the tumor is bifocal, it implies that there is at least one other focus. As there is no information suggesting that the other focus is larger than 0.55 mm, we can use this value as an estimate for the size of the largest focus.\n\nTo determine the T stage, we compare the estimated tumor size to the thresholds provided in the rules.\n\nT1: If the tumor is invasive and the tumor size is 2 cm or less, then the T stage is T1.\nT2: If the tumor is invasive and the tumor size is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm, then the T stage is T2.\nT3: If the tumor is invasive and the tumor size is more than 5 cm or if the tumor is invasive lobular carcinoma with a size that cannot be accurately determined and is estimated to be more than 5 cm, then the T stage is T3.\nT4: If the tumor is invasive and has direct extension to the chest wall or skin, then the T stage is T4.\n\nGiven that 0.55 mm is approximately 0.00055 meters, and 1 cm is 0.01 meters, the estimated tumor size in centimeters is 0.055 cm. This is clearly more than 2 cm but less than 5 cm.

Additionally, the report mentions that there is extensive vascular invasion and extranodal extension (>2mm) of carcinoma. These factors also support the T3 stage.","Clinical Diagnosis & History: Right multicentric IDC and ILC presents for bilateral TM, bilateral SLNBx.

Specimen measures 24 cm superior. to inferior, 23 cm medial to lateral, 4 cm anterior to posterior. Superficial skin ellipse measures 9.5 x 4 cm and displays a centrally. located inverted nipple. No scar is noted. No discharge is noted. Deep. resection margin shows scant portions of muscular tissue. Deep margin. inked black and superficial margin is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a. centrally located poorly defined firm pink white mass measuring 4.5 x 4.5. x. 2.0. cm. Periphery of the mass shows hemorrhage consistent with previous. biopsy. Mass abuts deep margin. Fibrous parenchyma surrounding mass is. nodular and cystic suggestive of additional foci. Located in the deep. margin of mid inner quadrant is a 0.4 cm firm tan ill defined nodule. consistent with possible additional lesion (located approximately 2 cm. from central lesion) . Sectioning of nipple shows dense fibrous tissue. with possible lesion involvement. Remainder of parenchyma is lobulated. yellow tan and fatty with scant fibrous tissue. No lymph nodes identified. Representative sections: A1: skin. A2: nipple. A3: mass (lateral portion). A4: mass and adjacent fibrous tissue (medial portion). Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued). A5: mid inner quadrant nodule with margins. A6: mass with deep margin (central). A7: upper outer quadrant. A8: lower outer quadrant. A9: lower inner quadrant. A10: upper inner quadrant . Matched sections of A1-A4 and A7-A10 are. submitted. for CBCP protocol. A11-A20 represent additional sections of mass. Remaining breast tissue is. unoriented, no sutures remain in tissue. Representative samples of lesion. beneath elliptical wedge of skin and nipple are represented. A13-A14. represent one match set. Specimen submitted. B. Received in formalin labeled with patient's name. labeled. ""RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS INCLUDING SARCO BUNDLE"" consists of an 11 x 6 x 3. cm irregular unoriented portion of fatty tissue. Sectioning reveals two. matted portions of soft tissue measuring 4 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and 8 x 4 x 1.2. cm. On sectioing the cut surfaces show dense indurated fibrotic tissue. with red tan lymphoid tissue noted along periphery of the smaller portion. tissue. Single intact discrete lymph node is identified and remaining. tissue which measures 0.6 cm. Exact number of lymph nodes cannot be. determined. Representative sections are as follows: B1-B3: smaller portion of tissue. B4-B6: larger portion of tissue. B7: one bisected lymph node."
