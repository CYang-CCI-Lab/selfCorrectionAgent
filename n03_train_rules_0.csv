Tumor type: invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive fibrosis (see comment). Nottingham combined histologic grade: 2. Tubule formation score: 2. Nuclear Pleomorphism Score: 3. Mitotic count score: 2. Focality of tumor: single focus. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.5 cm (see comment). Lymphovascular invasion: present (A8). In Situ Component: present. In Situ Component type/Architecture pattern: solid and cribriform. In Situ Component nuclear grade: 3. In Situ Component necrosis: none identified. In Situ Component extent/size: DCIS is present with tumor and focally away from tumor. Size is approximately 6 mm. Extensive intraductal component: Absent. The DCIS comprises approximately 2% of total tumor. Nipple involvement: none identified. Skin involvement: none identified. Margin status: nvasive component: >5 mm. in Situ component: >5 mm. Axillary lymph nodes: Total number with metastasis: 7. Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below). Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15). Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue. Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis. Other findings: - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Benign skeletal muscle. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to. change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal. - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core. biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has. been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm. nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was. confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single. focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined). Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficial and the other deep, but they were very close to each. other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to. deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies. (predominant morphology is that of the ""deep"" core with some areas resembling the ""superficial"" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial. core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were. performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy. (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling. the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficial. core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FISH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Estrogen receptor (: , clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive. Computer-assisted quantitative score: 100%.

An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17.

It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 480 grams and. measuring 24 x 18 x 5 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 17 x 4 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.5 cm in diameter nipple. [The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating 12:00]. The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. The anterior margin of resection is inked with blue ink. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm an ill-defined. white-tan mass which is 1.5 cm away from the deep fascial margin of resection. This mass is located in the upper outer quadrant. (approximately 2:00 position). The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray. mammary parenchyma. An axillary fat pad measuring 7 x 5 x 3 cm. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identified. Some lymph. nodes are white in and firm in consistency. The largest lymph node measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: B1 = nipple. B2-B5 = mass. B6 = mass closest deep fascial margin of resection. B7 = upper inner quadrant. B8 = lower inner quadrant. B9 = lower outer quadrant. B10 = 6 lymph nodes. B11 = bisection of a single lymph node. B12 = bisection of a single lymph node.
