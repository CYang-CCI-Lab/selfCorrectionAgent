| Reasoning: The maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is 1.9 cm, which falls under the T1 category. The T1 category is further divided into three substages: T1a (tumor size ≤ 0.5 cm), T1b (tumor size > 0.5 to 1 cm), and T1c (tumor size > 1 to 2 cm). Based on the tumor size of 1.9 cm, the T stage for this patient's cancer is T1c.                  |

| Reasoning: The size of the largest tumor is 2.0 cm, which falls under the T2 category (T1 being ≤2 cm, T2 being >2 to 5 cm, T3 being >5 cm, and T4 involving the chest wall or skin). This information can be found in the 'SIZE OF INVASIVE COMPONENT' section of the report, which states 'Greatest dimension: 2.0 cm'.                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor size is 1.7 cm, which falls under the T1 category. The report mentions that the tumor has an intermediate histologic and nuclear grade, with a Nottingham score of 5. This suggests that the tumor is moderately differentiated and has a moderate risk of recurrence and metastasis. The report does not mention the presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The report does not mention the presence of lymph node metastasis.                  |

| Reasoning: The largest dimension of the invasive component of the tumor measures 1.8 cm, which falls under the T1 category. The report specifies that the tumor is not T4 as it does not involve the chest wall or skin. However, since the tumor is larger than 1 cm, it is classified as T1c.                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor in the right breast measures 1.3 cm, which falls under the T1 category. However, the report mentions that the tumor extends to within 2 mm of the superior margin, indicating that it is close to exceeding the 2 cm limit for T1. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor and its proximity to the superior margin, we can classify it as T2.                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor measures 1.4 cm, which falls under the T1 category. However, the pathology report has classified it as T2 (pTlc). This could be due to the use of the 'pTlc' notation, which indicates that the tumor has a largest contiguous cross-sectional size of 1.4 cm but may have an overall size that falls into the T2 category. Alternatively, the 'lc' notation may indicate a specific subtype or characteristic of the tumor that leads to the T2 classification. Without further information, we will defer to the 'pTlc' classification provided in the report.                  |

| Reasoning: The report states that the size of the largest invasive carcinoma is 1.6 cm, which falls within the T1 category (T1a: tumor >0.1 cm but ≤0.5 cm, T1b: tumor >0.5 cm but ≤1 cm, T1c: tumor >1 cm but ≤2 cm). The report also mentions that the tumor does not invade the skin or chest wall, supporting the T1 classification. The patient has involvement of 2 lymph nodes, which falls under the N1 category. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so it is assumed that the patient is M0.                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor measures 2.6 cm, which falls under the T1 category. However, the tumor is located in the outer lower quadrant and is close to the base and skin, suggesting that the T stage may be higher than T1. The final T stage determination should be made by a qualified healthcare professional who has access to the complete medical record and can consider all relevant factors.                  |

| Reasoning: The maximum dimension of the invasive component in the left breast is 28 mm, which falls under the T2 category (T stage is based on the size of the tumor, with T1 being ≤2 cm, T2 being >2 to 5 cm, T3 being >5 cm, and T4 involving the chest wall or skin). The maximum dimension of the invasive component in the right breast is 11 mm, which falls under the T1c category (T1 tumors are further divided into T1mi, T1a, T1b, and T1c based on size, with T1c being >10 to 15 mm).                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, which falls under the T3 category.

The report states that the largest tumor measures 5.0 cm, which supports the T3 classification.                  |

| Reasoning: The tumor in the left breast measures 4.5 cm in greatest dimension, which is larger than the threshold for a T3 tumor (greater than or equal to 5.1 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the invasive component of the tumor, not the in-situ component. The T stage is determined by the largest diameter of the tumor, as measured in centimeters.                  |

| Reasoning: The maximum dimension of the invasive component of the tumor is 1.5 cm, which falls under the T1 category. The T1 category is further divided into T1a (tumor size ≤ 0.5 cm), T1b (tumor size > 0.5 cm but ≤ 1 cm), and T1c (tumor size > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm). In this case, the tumor size is 1.5 cm, which falls under the T1c category.                  |

The T1 category can be further classified as T1mi (minimal), T1a (0.1-0.5 cm), T1b (0.5-1 cm), or T1c (>1-2 cm). In this case, the tumor size is greater than 1 cm but less than 2 cm, so the T stage is T1c.                  |

| Reasoning: The report mentions the size of the surgical specimen as 5 x 4 x 2 cm. The largest dimension of the tumor is 5 cm, which falls within the range for T2 tumors (greater than 2 cm and up to 5 cm).                  |
