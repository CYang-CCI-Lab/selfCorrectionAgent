There is 3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed. that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All. carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein.

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum.

Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 381 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this. orientation, the specimen measures 16 cm from medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 4. cm from anterior to posterior. There is an overlying ellipse of tan skin measuring 11.8 x 7 cm. The areola. measures 3.3 cm and the nipple appears slightly inverted. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin. which consists variably of smooth facial. appearing tissue and lobulated fatty tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned along the. superior-inferior axis resulting in fifteen slabs. Slab #1 is most medial. In the central portion of the excision, in slabs 6-9, there is a stellate hard, gritty neoplasm (tumor #1) which. overall measures 4 cm from medial to lateral, 1.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 1 cm from anterior to. posterior. This neoplasm is 1.5 cm from the closest skin. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin. and is greater than 4 cm from all other margins. Representative sections of the medial portion of the tissue. are obtained for research purposes and the biopsy site clip is identified within the neoplasm in slab 7. Slab 10 (intervening tissue between tumor #1 and tumors #2 and #3) consists of palpably unremarkable. fibrofatty tissue. In slab 11, 1 cm lateral to the tumor #1, there is chalky yellow discoloration and slight retraction of the. fibrofatty tissue suggestive of two small deposits of neoplastic tissue. The larger of these (tumor #2) is 8 cm. lateral to the nipple. It measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.6 cm and is greater than 2 cm from the anterior-superior,. anterior-inferior, and posterior margins. It is 2.3 cm from the closest lateral margin and widely free of the. medial margin. The smaller tumor deposit (tumor #3) measures 0,5 cm and is 0.8 cm superior of the larger deposit in slab. 11.

There is an overlying broad ellipse of tan skin which measures 12 x 7 cm. In the lateral skin, there is a 0.4 cm violaceous skin lesion. Centrally, there is a well-delineated 4 cm. areola and a flat to slightly retracted appearing 1 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue,. the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of lobulated fatty. tissue, with central fascial appearing tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close. intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white fibrous parenchyma which is most. prominent centrally. The fibrous parenchyma is focally finely nodular to palpation but there are no. discrete areas suggestive of invasive neoplasm. There are scattered small fluid-filled cysts within the. fibrous parenchyma. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of Sections: BFS1 - two potential sentinel lymph nodes, entirely submitted. B2 - remaining soft tissue. C. The next container is labeled ""C - left breast at 12 o'clock. with left axillary node dissection."" The specimen consists of a 613 gm. modified radical mastectomy with axillary tail. The breast measures 17. cm medial to lateral, 15.5 cm superior to inferior and 3.9 cm. superficial to deep. The attached axillary tail measures 8 X 7.5 x 2. cm. There is an attached ovoid portion of skin measuring 4 X 3.5 cm. with an everted, freely mobile nipple which measures 2.5 X 2.5 cm with. the areolar complex. The deep fascial plane is inked black, the. remaining superior half is inked blue with the remaining inferior half. inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. A gray-white, firm, irregularly-bordered mass is identified in the. upper outer quadrant measuring 3.2 X 2.2 X 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. This mass is consistent with a bilobed single mass. However, it could. represent two separate masses. The central area of the mass is. submitted which could represent normal parenchyma in between the two. masses. The mass is 1.8 cm to the deep margin and 2.5 cm to the nipple. A dumbbell-shaped biopsy clip is identified near the medial portion of. the mass. There are firm, indurated possibly calcified areas located. posteriorly to the nipple.
