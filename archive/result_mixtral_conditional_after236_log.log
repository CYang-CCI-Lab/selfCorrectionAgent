| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 8 cm, which falls in the T3 category of the TNM staging system for breast cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being less than or equal to 2.0 cm, T2 being greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm, T3 being greater than 5.0 cm, and T4 being direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The T stage does not consider the degree of differentiation, in situ spread, angioinvasion, or lymph node involvement. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'lesion is grossly within 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm' which is the size of the tumor. According to the rules provided, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The report states that the largest tumor focus measures 1.1 cm in diameter, but it also mentions that the lesion is grossly within 1.8 cm in the inferior, superior, medial, lateral, posterior, and anterior surgical margins. Therefore, the T stage is T1c, which refers to a tumor size of 1.0-2.0 cm in greatest dimension. |

| reasoning : The report mentions two invasive lobular carcinoma areas with sizes 2.8 cm and 1.8 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being less than or equal to 2.0 cm, T2 being greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm, T3 being greater than 5.0 cm, and T4 being direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Since both tumors are greater than 2.0 cm but less than or equal to 5.0 cm, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report specifies that the T stage is T1, which means the tumor has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. This is based on the rule that T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being less than or equal to 2.0 cm, T2 being greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm, T3 being greater than 5.0 cm, and T4 being direct extension to the chest wall or skin. The report specifies that the T stage is T1, so no further interpretation is needed. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. According to the report, the patient's tumor is a T2 stage as its diameter is greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm. This information is based on the rule: 'Tumor diameter is used to determine T stage, with T1 being less than or equal to 2.0 cm, T2 being greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm, T3 being greater than 5.0 cm, and T4 being direct extension to the chest wall or skin.' |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. According to the report, the tumor size is not specified but falls within the T2 category, which is for tumors with a minimum diameter of 2.0 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. The report states that the tumor is an 'Infiltrative ductal carcinoma' located in the 'Right Breast' with a 'T Stage: 2', which supports this prediction. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is 5.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm). The report does not provide any information about direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so we cannot classify it as a T4 tumor. The T stage is based on the largest dimension of the tumor, and in this case, that is 5.0 cm, making it a T2 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is 5.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm). The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it cannot be a T4 tumor. The tumor size is too small to be a T3 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the invasive carcinoma cannot be accurately determined due to its diffuse nature, but it is estimated to span an area of about 4.5 cm. This means that the tumor is larger than 2.0 cm (T1) and less than or equal to 5.0 cm (T2). Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of a lesion in the lower inner quadrant of the breast that measures 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Based on the given rules, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm, while T3 tumors have a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm. Since the size of the tumor is not explicitly stated to be less than or equal to 2.0 cm, it is possible that the tumor is a T2 or T3 stage. The exact T stage cannot be determined without more precise information about the size of the tumor. |

| reasoning : The report mentions 'multiple foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, nos type, histologic grade II-III/III, nuclear grade II/III, ranging in size from 0.1-2.5 cm (the two largest foci of tumor measure 1.4 cm and 2.5 cm grossly)'. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is 2.5 cm, making it a T2 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is 5.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T3 tumor (greater than 5.0 cm). The report also states that the tumor extends to the skin, which is a characteristic of T4 tumors. However, since the T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not consider direct extension to the skin, the T stage would still be T3. |

| reasoning : The report states that the invasive lobular carcinoma in the left breast measures at least 2.0 cm in its largest contiguous span (addendum diagnosis). However, the exact size of the tumor is difficult to assess as it is present as multiple nodules that merge into one another. Therefore, the T stage could be either T2 (2.1-5.0 cm) or T3 (>5.0 cm) but cannot be definitively determined based on the information provided. |

| reasoning : The report mentions multiple foci of invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast, with the largest tumor measuring 1.8 cm in size. Based on the rules provided, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm, while T3 tumors have a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is either T2 or T3, depending on the exact size of the largest tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a single mass with a largest dimension of 7.2 cm. According to the rules, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. However, the report specifies that the tumor is a T2 stage tumor, so the tumor size falls within the range specified for that T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a mass with the largest dimension of 2.3 cm, which falls within the range of T2 tumors (2.1-5.0 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor in the affected breast, and it does not consider in situ components or other factors such as lymphovascular invasion or margin status. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 'well circumscribed mass (4.2 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm)' in the lower outer quadrant of the breast. The T stage is based on the largest dimension of the tumor, which in this case is 4.2 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm mass in the right breast, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm). The presence of in situ carcinoma or fibroadenoma does not affect the T stage, as it is based solely on the size of the tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass, which falls within the size range for a T2 tumor (minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and maximum diameter of 5.0 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the largest dimension of the tumor is 2.3 cm. The report also states that there is vascular invasion, but the T stage does not consider this factor. |

| reasoning : Based on the report, there are two invasive tumors present in the breast. The largest tumor, an infiltrating lobular carcinoma, has a measured size of 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm, which falls within the T1 category. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, and does not consider in situ components or other factors such as lymphovascular invasion or margin status. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1c. |

| reasoning : The report specifies that the largest tumor measures 4.3 x 3.4 x 3.2 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor in the affected breast, and does not consider in situ components or other factors such as lymphovascular invasion or margin status. The report also specifies that the non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative fibrocystic changes, which further supports the diagnosis of a T2 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest mass of the infiltrating ductal carcinoma has a size of 2.6 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm. This exceeds the maximum diameter of 2.0 cm for T1 tumors and falls within the range of 2.1 to 5.0 cm for T2 tumors. |

| reasoning : The report specifically mentions that the tumor involves the overlying skin (AJCC pT4), which meets the criteria for a T4 tumor. The size of the tumor (2.8 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm) falls within the range for a T2 or T3 tumor, but since the T4 criterion is met, the T stage is T4. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the largest tumor is 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. This falls within the range for a T1 tumor, which has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The fact that there is also a focus of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) outside the main tumor mass does not affect the T stage, as the T stage is based solely on the size of the primary tumor and does not consider in situ components or other factors such as lymphovascular invasion or margin status. |

| reasoning : The report mentions that the invasive lobular carcinoma forms a 2.8 x 2.6 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm mass. The T stage is based on the largest dimension of the tumor, which in this case is 6.0 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. However, the report specifies a size larger than 5.0 cm, which suggests that the T stage should be T3. But, since the rules provided do not mention the possibility of T stages larger than T2, we will assume that the T stage follows the same range as T2 but with a larger maximum diameter. Therefore, we predict the T stage to be T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 1.3 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm mass. Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The tumor in this report is smaller than 2.0 cm, so it falls under the T1 category. The specific T1 subcategory is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1a being up to 0.5 cm, T1b being between 0.6 cm and 1.0 cm, and T1c being between 1.1 cm and 2.0 cm. In this case, the tumor is 1.3 cm, which falls in the T1c category. |

| reasoning : The report specifies that the largest tumor has a size of 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, which falls within the range for T1c tumors (1.1 cm to 2.0 cm in maximum diameter). The report also specifies that there is no direct extension to the chest wall or skin, and the T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and does not consider lymph node metastasis or the presence of lymphovascular invasion or margin status. |

| reasoning : The report states that the invasive tumor in the right breast measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm, which falls within the T2 category (2.1 cm to 5.0 cm). The presence of a separate nodule of ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ does not affect the T stage, as it is based on the size of the invasive component only. The report also specifies that the tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the invasive carcinoma is 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm, which falls within the range for a T1 tumor (maximum diameter of 2.0 cm). The specific T stage given in the report is pT1c, which also confirms that the tumor is a T1 stage. The report also mentions that the tumor is negative for angiolymphatic involvement and has negative surgical resection margins, but these factors do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is based on the size of the tumor, as reported in the pathology results. In this report, the largest dimension of the tumor is 9.2 cm, which falls within the range for a T3 tumor (minimum diameter of 5.1 cm). The report specifies that this is the size of the invasive component of the tumor, not the in situ component. The T stage does not consider the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion or margin status. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor has a size of 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm. The T stage is based on the largest dimension of the tumor, which in this case is 1.8 cm. According to the rules provided, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. Furthermore, T1 tumors are divided into T1a (up to 0.5 cm), T1b (between 0.6 cm and 1.0 cm), and T1c (between 1.1 cm and 2.0 cm). Therefore, the largest tumor in this report falls under the T1c category. |

| reasoning : The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not consider lymph node metastasis or other factors such as lymphovascular invasion or margin status. In this report, the left breast tumor measures 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm (largest dimension 0.9 cm), which falls under T1. However, the right breast tumor measures 12.5 x 6.3 x 2.2 cm (largest dimension 12.5 cm), which falls under T3. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3. |

| reasoning : The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor in the affected breast. In this report, the left breast has an infiltrating lobular carcinoma with a size of 4.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category (2.1-5.0 cm). The right breast has an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a size of 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm, which is a T1c tumor (1.1-2.0 cm). However, the T stage is assigned based on the size of the largest tumor, which is in the left breast. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The largest mass in the left breast measures 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm, which is greater than 2.0 cm and less than 5.0 cm. This falls within the T3 category, which includes tumors with a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm. However, since the report does not provide a measurement that is 5.1 cm or larger, we cannot use a higher T stage. |

| reasoning : The report mentions that the tumor is multifocal intraductal and infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 2/3, with the largest tumor extending to within 0.1mm of the surgical margin. However, it does not provide information on the size of the largest tumor. Based on the rules provided, the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. Since the report does not provide this information, we cannot determine a T stage higher than T1. The report mentions that the tumor is multifocal, but the T stage is still based on the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the T stage is T1, with the understanding that the exact subcategory (T1a, T1b, or T1c) cannot be determined without further information. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor measured 5.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm, which falls within the T2 category of having a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor and does not consider other factors such as lymph node metastasis or direct extension to the skin. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor in the right breast biopsy is 3.6 cm (3.6 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm). According to the rules provided, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. However, T1 tumors are further divided into T1a (up to 0.5 cm), T1b (between 0.6 cm and 1.0 cm), and T1c (between 1.1 cm and 2.0 cm). Since the tumor size is 3.6 cm, it does not fit into any of the T1 subcategories. However, since the report does not provide information on the size of the largest tumor being higher than 3.6 cm, the T stage cannot be higher than T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is 5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm). The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so there is no evidence of a T4 tumor. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not consider in situ components, lymphovascular invasion, or margin status. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor measures 2.0 cm in greatest diameter, which falls within the range for T1 tumors (up to 2.0 cm). There is no mention of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, which rules out T4 tumors. The T stage is not affected by the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis or the number of positive lymph nodes, so the fact that no tumor is seen in fifteen axillary lymph nodes does not impact the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'right breast status post biopsy for invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive residual invasive carcinoma extending into the deep dermis' and measures 6 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. This is larger than the maximum diameter of a T2 tumor (5.0 cm) and does not have direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is a T3 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'extensive infiltrating lobular carcinoma' has a greatest dimension in excess of 6 cm, which puts it in the T3 category. The T3 category does not have a maximum diameter, so the fact that the tumor is multifocal and extensive does not affect the T stage assignment. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is approximately 2.2 cm. Based on the rules provided, this falls within the range for a T2 tumor, which has a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. The report also mentions that the surgical margins are positive for carcinoma, but this information is not used to determine the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T2. |

| reasoning : The tumor size in the mastectomy specimen is 7 cm in greatest dimension, which falls within the T3 category of having a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm and no maximum diameter. This is further supported by the statement 'The overall tumor size is mostly likely 9 cm in greatest dimension', which also indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'gross tumor size, 2.2 CM' and 'size of invasive component, 1.6 CM'. Based on the rules provided, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. Although the size of the tumor is slightly larger than 2.0 cm, the report specifies that the size of the invasive component is 1.6 cm. Therefore, the T stage can be accurately predicted as T1, as the invasive component falls within the size range for T1 tumors. |

| reasoning : The report states that there are two tumors, one in the upper-outer quadrant with a size of 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm and one in the lower-inner quadrant with a size of 1 cm. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is the 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm tumor in the upper-outer quadrant. This tumor falls within the T2 category, which has a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest mass measures approximately 6.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm, which is within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm in maximum diameter). The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it cannot be a T4 tumor. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not consider lymph node metastasis or the number of positive lymph nodes, so the information about the negative lymph nodes does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest diameter of the tumor is 3.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm). The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so it is not a T4 tumor. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not consider lymph node metastasis or the number of positive lymph nodes, so the information about the lymph nodes is not relevant to the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is 1.5 cm, which falls within the range for T1 tumors (up to 2.0 cm). There is no indication of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so the T stage is not T4. The T stage is not T3 because T3 tumors do not have a maximum diameter. The T stage is not T2 because T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm. |

| reasoning : Based on the information provided in the pathology report, there are three separate foci of breast carcinoma in the left breast. The largest of these tumors, carcinoma number one, measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumors with a minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm. The other two tumors are smaller and do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is approximately 7.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm, which is larger than the maximum size for T2 tumors (5.0 cm) and does not have direct extension to the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage is T3. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is reported as 6.0 cm in the modified mastectomy specimen, which falls under the category of T3 tumors having a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm and no maximum diameter. This is further supported by the gross tumor size of at least 6.0 cm reported in the modified mastectomy diagnosis. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest dimension of the tumor is approximately 2.7 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (minimum diameter of 2.1 cm and maximum diameter of 5.0 cm). The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so there is no indication of a T4 tumor. The T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and does not consider other factors such as lymph node metastasis or the presence of lymphovascular invasion or margin status. |

| reasoning : The tumor size in this report is 12 x 9.5 x 4 cm, which is larger than the maximum size for T2 tumors (5.0 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the invasive component of the tumor, not the in situ component. The report does not mention direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so we cannot rule out T4, but based solely on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T3. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'GROSS TUMOR SIZE: 1.6 CM', which falls within the range for a T1 tumor (maximum diameter of 2.0 cm).

The T stage is not based on the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis, so the information about in-situ carcinoma does not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the biopsy is 3.1 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm and that the specimen is entirely submitted for examination. The largest dimension of the tumor is 1.5 cm, which falls within the T1 category. The report does not provide information on the presence or absence of direct extension to the chest wall or skin, but this is not considered in the T stage for invasive carcinomas. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage is T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor has a diameter of 3 cm, which falls within the size range for a T3 tumor (no maximum diameter). The T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and does not consider other factors such as lymph node metastasis or the presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). |
