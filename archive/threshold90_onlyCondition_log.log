| reasoning : The tumor diameter is 3.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.1-5.0 cm) as per the given rules. The fact that it is a poorly differentiated invasive malignant tumor, with focal in situ spread and marked angioinvasion, does not affect the T stage determination. |

| reasoning : The maximum diameter of the tumor is 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 tumor (2.0 cm to 5.0 cm) as stated in the rules. The fact that it is an invasive lobular carcinoma also supports this classification, as tumor diameter is the key factor in determining the T stage for this type of cancer. |

| reasoning : The maximum diameter of the tumor is approximately 4.5 cm, which falls within the T3 category of having a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm or greater. This is determined by the largest tumor diameter, regardless of the histological type of breast carcinoma, and tumor diameter is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. The AJCC staging system considers the tumor size to determine the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma, and the polymorphocellular variant of invasive lobular breast carcinoma is also considered in this determination. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is reported as 7 cm in greatest dimension, which exceeds the maximum diameter of 5.0 cm for a T2 tumor and the minimum diameter of 5.1 cm for a T3 tumor. The report also indicates that the tumor invades the dermis and is associated with overlying epidermal ulceration, which meets the criteria for a T4 tumor. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and tumor diameter is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage. The absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node and the absence or presence of genomic studies do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor diameter is at least 65 mm (6.5 cm), which puts it in the T3 category according to the rule 'T3 tumors have a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm'. The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, and skin invasion do not affect the T stage according to the rules provided. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the tumor size is 10.0 x 10.0 x 7.2 cm, which means the largest diameter is 10.0 cm. According to the rules, T1 tumors have a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm, T2 tumors have a minimum diameter of 2.0 cm and a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm, and T3 tumors have a minimum diameter of 5.1 cm. Therefore, the tumor in this report is a T3 tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 2.6 cm, which falls within the range for T2 tumors (2.1-5.0 cm). The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and in situ spread does not affect the T stage. The tumor stage is also not affected by the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node or the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size for the right breast is 7.8 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm, which is larger than the maximum diameter of a T2 tumor (5.0 cm). The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and tumor diameter is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3. |

Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the patient was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is T2. The T stage is not affected by the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node or the absence or presence of genomic studies. The grade (G) and nodes (N) classifications are not used to determine the T stage. The T stage is the primary factor in determining the stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage. |

| reasoning : According to the pathology report, the patient is diagnosed with breast cancer and the histological description is infiltrative ductal carcinoma. The T stage is reported as T2. This is consistent with the rules provided, as the T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide information on the size of the tumor, but since it is reported as T2, we can assume that the tumor size is within this range. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, regardless of the histological type of breast carcinoma. The report does not provide information on the tumor size, but it mentions that the patient has infiltrative ductal-lobular carcinoma. Since the T stage is not affected by the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node, we can assume that the T stage is based solely on the tumor size. As per the AJCC staging system, T3 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, based on the available information, we can predict that the patient's T stage is T3. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma with a T stage of 2. Based on the rules provided, T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide the exact tumor size, but it does specify a T2 stage, which implies a tumor size greater than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma with a T stage of 2. This corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide information on the exact tumor size, but it does specify a T2 stage. The patient's grade is 2, which is not used to determine the T stage. The absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node, genomic studies, lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, and skin invasion do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the patient was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is 2. The rules provided state that tumor size is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, and T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the predicted T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. The report mentions that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma in the right breast, but it does not provide information about the tumor size. However, it does specify that the T stage is 4, which corresponds to a tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall and/or the skin (ulceration or skin nodules). Therefore, based on the information provided in the report and the rules learned, the predicted T stage for this patient is T4. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and satellite foci or other factors do not alter the T stage. The report indicates that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma in the left breast, and the T stage is reported as 2. This suggests that the largest tumor diameter is between 2.1 cm and 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the patient has been diagnosed with Infiltrative lobular carcinoma in the right breast, with a T Stage of 1. This means that the tumor has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The report does not provide information about the size of the tumor, but since T1 is the initial stage, we can assume that the tumor size is less than or equal to 2.0 cm. The N Stage is 0, which means that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, and the M Stage is also 0, indicating that there are no distant metastases. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the patient has been diagnosed with Infiltrative lobular carcinoma in the right breast, with a T Stage of 1. This means that the tumor has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The report does not provide information about the size of the tumor, but since T1 is the initial stage, we can assume that the tumor size is less than or equal to 2.0 cm. The N Stage is 0, which means that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, and the M Stage is also 0, indicating that there are no distant metastases. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the tumor is an infiltrative ductal carcinoma with a T stage of 2. This corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide the exact tumor size, but it does specify a T2 stage, which indicates a tumor size within the aforementioned range. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the patient was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma, and the T stage is T2, which corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide information about the tumor size, but since T1 is up to 2.0 cm, and T2 starts from more than 2.0 cm, we can infer that the tumor size is more than 2.0 cm, making it a T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. According to the report, the patient was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma and the T stage is 2. This indicates a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The other factors mentioned in the report such as grade, normal sample, and anatomic site do not affect the T stage determination. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the report specifies a T Stage of 2. According to the rules, T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report does not provide information on the tumor size, but since T Stage 2 was assigned, we can infer that the tumor size is within the T2 range. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the patient is female and diagnosed with breast cancer, specifically infiltrative ductal carcinoma. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. No tumor diameter information is provided in this report, but the stage is given as 1c. According to the AJCC staging system, stage 1c corresponds to a T1 tumor (2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension) with either greater than 0.5 mm tumor deposit in the lymphatic, vascular, or neural tissue or a grade 3 tumor. Since the grade is 2, we can assume that the T1 classification is due to the tumor size being 2.0 cm or less. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and satellite foci or other factors do not alter the T stage. The report indicates that the patient has infiltrative ductal carcinoma in the left breast, and the T stage is reported as 2. This suggests that the largest tumor diameter is between 2.1 cm and 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor is 6.5 cm in largest dimension, which falls within the range for T2 stage (> 2.0 cm to 5.0 cm). The presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage, and the histological type of breast carcinoma is invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor size is 0.4 cm, which falls under the T1 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and the absence of vascular invasion, skin involvement, or positive surgical margins do not affect the T stage determination. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. |

| reasoning : Based on the report, there are two tumors in the right breast, with the largest one measuring 3.6 cm in greatest dimension. This puts the tumor stage at T2, as T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. |

| reasoning : The report states that the invasive ductal carcinoma measures 6 cm in largest dimension. According to the rules provided, T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. However, the rule also states that the T stage is not affected by the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node, and the report indicates that one of the sentinel lymph nodes is positive for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the T2 stage is the appropriate stage for this tumor. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the invasive ductal carcinoma measures 1.1 cm in largest dimension. According to the rules provided, T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. However, the report states that the tumor is 1.1 cm, which falls outside of the T2 range. It is important to note that the T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, there are two separate tumor nodules: one is located in the upper outer quadrant and shows an invasive ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated, measuring 3.9 cm in largest dimension grossly. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of a 'pinkish red, relatively well-circumscribed and firm lesion measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm' in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this case, the largest dimension of the tumor is 3 cm, which falls under the T2 stage (a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension) according to the AJCC staging system. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor diameter is 5.5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage according to the AJCC staging system. The presence of satellite foci, lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, skin involvement, and positive non-neoplastic breast tissue do not affect the T stage. The T stage is determined solely by the largest tumor diameter for invasive lobular carcinoma. |

| reasoning : The report mentions that there are two distinct tumor masses in the lower inner quadrant, with the larger one measuring 2 x 1 x 1 cm. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and in this case, it is more than 2.0 cm but less than 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor diameter is 4.9 cm, which falls within the range for T2 stage (> 2.0 cm to 5.0 cm). The focality of the tumor is unifocal, and there is no in situ component, lymphovascular invasion, skin involvement, or nipple involvement. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.0 cm mass, which falls in the T2 stage category (maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm) according to the AJCC staging system. The presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor is a Nottingham grade III ductal adenocarcinoma with a greatest dimension of 5.5 cm. This places the tumor in the T2 stage, as T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The presence of additional tumors does not affect the T stage, as it is determined solely by the largest tumor diameter. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm mass in the right breast. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest mass measures 3.2 x 2.7 x 2.3 cm, which is greater than 2.0 cm in greatest dimension, classifying it as T2. The presence of multiple satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor diameter is 3.2 cm, which falls under the T2 stage (maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm). The presence of satellite foci or other factors such as angiolymphatic invasion, high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, and surgical margin status do not affect the T stage determination for breast cancer. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 4.7 x 4.0 x 2.7 cm mass, located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. According to the rules, the T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this case, the largest tumor diameter is 4.7 cm, which falls under the T2 stage (corresponding to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension). |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor mass is 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. Based on the rules provided, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The presence of satellite foci or other factors such as lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, skin invasion, and the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1. |

| reasoning : The report describes two invasive cancer masses in the breast, one identified as infiltrating lobular carcinoma (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm) and the other as infiltrating ductal carcinoma (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm). The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this case, the largest tumor is the infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a size of 1.7 cm, which falls under the T1 category (maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less). |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor mass measures 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm, which is less than or equal to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. According to the rules, tumor size is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma, and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage. Therefore, the T stage is T1. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms multiple masses with the largest one measuring 4.3 x 3.4 x 3.2 cm. According to the rules provided, tumor size is the primary factor in determining the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The T2 stage corresponds to a tumor size of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter and the presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a mass with a size of 2.8 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm, which is larger than 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Additionally, the report states that the tumor involves the overlying skin (AJCC pT4), which is a factor that contributes to the T4 stage. |

| reasoning : The report specifies that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a mass with the greatest dimension of 1.9 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ and the absence of angiolymphatic invasion do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the invasive lobular carcinoma forms a 2.8 x 2.6 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm mass. The key factor in determining the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma is the tumor size. The AJCC staging system considers the tumor size to determine the T stage, and polymorphocellular variant of invasive lobular breast carcinoma is also considered. In this case, the largest tumor diameter is 6.0 cm, which falls under the T2 category (T2: tumor size >2.0 cm and ≤5.0 cm). |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor diameter is 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm, which falls in the T2 category (tumor size >2.0 cm and <=5.0 cm). The presence of satellite foci or other factors such as ductal carcinoma in situ, angiovascular invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter in breast cancer. In this report, there are two separate masses with the largest one being 5.3 x 2.7 x 1.4 cm, which is larger than 2.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a T3 stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm mass, which is less than or equal to 2.0 cm in maximum diameter. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ, angiovascular invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node and the absence or presence of genomic studies also do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor is found in the left breast, measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm, which falls into the T3 category (tumor size > 5.0 cm). The right breast tumor measures 1.7 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm, which is a T1 tumor, but since the T stage is determined by the largest tumor, the T1 measurement does not affect the overall T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor diameter is 1.3 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm, which is less than 2.0 cm. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The absence of ductal carcinoma in situ, angiolymphatic invasion, and close margins do not affect the T stage. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of other factors such as satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer or invasive ductal carcinoma. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the tumor is described as forming a mass with dimensions of 5.7 x 4.8 x 2.1 cm. The largest diameter is 5.7 cm, which falls in the T3 category (tumors greater than 5 cm). The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ, angiolymphatic invasion, and negative surgical margins do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor diameter is 1.6 cm, which falls under the T1 category of tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less. The presence of satellite foci (multiple masses) does not affect the T stage, and the tumor grade (Nottingham grade III) and lymph node involvement are not used to determine the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the tumor size is given as 2.4 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm, which means the largest diameter is 2.4 cm. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm are classified as T2. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter in invasive ductal carcinoma. The report mentions a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm mass in the wide local excision specimen, which indicates a T2 stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ, angiovascular invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. |

| reasoning : The report states that the infiltrating ductal carcinoma forms a mass with a maximum diameter of 1.5 cm. Based on the rules provided, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ, angiolymphatic invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node, genomic studies, or lobular carcinoma in situ also does not affect the T stage. |

The presence of ductular involvement, absence of angiolymphatic involvement, and negative surgical resection margins do not affect the T stage. The absence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node also does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the tumor is described as forming a mass that measures 8 x 7.5 x 5 cm, which is larger than the 2.0 cm threshold for T1. There is no mention of skin invasion, so the T stage is not elevated to T4. Therefore, the T stage is T3. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the tumor is described as forming an 11.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm mass, which is larger than the 2.0 cm threshold for T1. Therefore, the T stage is either T2, T3, or T4. However, the report also states that the tumor involves the breast extensively, but does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. This information suggests that the tumor is confined to the breast tissue and has not invaded the skin or chest wall. Therefore, the T stage is T3, as T4 requires skin invasion. The absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node, genomic studies, lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, or margin status does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is primarily determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor mass is found in the total mastectomy specimen, measuring 5.2 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage is T3, as it indicates a tumor size of more than 5.0 cm and less than or equal to 10.0 cm, and the tumor is confined to the breast. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the largest tumor diameter is 9.2 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm, which is larger than 5.0 cm but less than or equal to 10.0 cm. This meets the criteria for a T3 stage tumor. The presence of a separate nodule, lobular carcinoma in situ, and the absence of angiolymphatic invasion do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : According to the pathology report, the largest tumor diameter is 4.8 cm, which falls under the T2 category of the AJCC staging system for breast cancer. The report states that the tumor is an infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and the T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter for this type of cancer. The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ, biopsy site changes, and negative surgical margins do not affect the T stage. The absence of skin invasion also supports the T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the left breast tumor is 0.9 cm (T1) and the right breast tumor is 12.5 cm (T3). Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T3. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor mass measures 2.7 x 2.3 x 1.7 cm, which is less than or equal to 2.0 cm. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less are classified as T1. The absence of skin invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, and the presence of negative surgical margins support this prediction. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this report, the left breast tumor is measured as 4.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm, which makes it a T2 stage tumor. The right breast tumor is measured as 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm, which is a T1c stage tumor. However, the T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, so the T stage for this report is T2. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is reported as 3.5 x 2 x 2 cm, which is larger than 2.0 cm, classifying it as T2 or higher. There is no mention of skin ulceration or chest wall invasion, so the T stage is not affected by these factors. The presence of in-situ carcinoma, multifocal tumor, lymphatic/vascular invasion, or margin status does not affect the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. |

| reasoning : The tumor in the right breast measures 4.5 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm, which is larger than 2.0 cm in maximum diameter. Therefore, the T stage is T2 or higher. The report does not mention any other factors such as skin ulceration or chest wall invasion that would upgrade the T stage to T3 or T4. Thus, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the patient is a female with a right breast mass, multifocal infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 2/3, with the tumor extending to within 0.1mm of the surgical margin. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and in this case, the report does not provide a specific measurement. However, it does mention that the tumor is multifocal and infiltrating, which suggests that the tumor is larger than 2.0 cm, classifying it as T2 or higher. Since the report does not mention any factors that would classify it as T3 or T4, such as skin ulceration or chest wall invasion, we can assume that the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor measures 2.0 cm in greatest diameter, which falls within the criteria for T1 tumors (maximum diameter of 2.0 cm or less). The presence of satellite foci or other factors such as ductal carcinoma in situ, angiovascular invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for breast cancer. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T1. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of a 'main tumor mass' that measures 6 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The T stage is determined by the largest tumor diameter. In this case, the largest diameter of the main tumor mass is 6 cm, which falls under the T2 category (tumors with a maximum diameter of more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor is a poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive vascular invasion and features of lobular carcinoma, but an in situ component is not present. The tumor size is not explicitly stated in the report, but the gross examination mentions a fragment of skin that is 3.3 cm long and 0.4 cm in diameter, and a representative fragment of a larger lesion. The T stage for breast cancer is determined by the largest tumor diameter, and the presence of other factors such as vascular invasion or margin status does not alter the T stage. However, skin invasion is a factor that contributes to the T4 stage. Therefore, based on the available information, the T stage is predicted to be T4. |

| reasoning : The report mentions a single breast mass that measures 7.0 cm in greatest dimension. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm are classified as T2. The presence of other factors such as skin invasion, ductal carcinoma in situ, angiovascular invasion, or margin status does not alter the T stage for invasive ductal carcinoma. The report also mentions that all final surgical margins are negative for cancer, which supports the T2 stage prediction. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, which falls within the T2 category (tumors with a maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm and up to 5.0 cm). The presence of satellite foci or other factors does not alter the T stage for breast cancer, and the absence of skin invasion also supports the T2 classification. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the invasive lobular carcinoma is approximately 7.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. According to the rules, tumors with a maximum diameter of more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm are classified as T2. The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, or the absence or presence of tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node does not affect the T stage. The AJCC staging system considers the tumor size to determine the T stage for invasive lobular carcinoma. |

| reasoning : The tumor size in the modified mastectomy specimen is at least 6.0 cm, which places it in the T2 category according to the AJCC staging system. The presence of skin invasion or lymphovascular invasion does not affect the T stage, and the absence of genomic studies does not either. |
