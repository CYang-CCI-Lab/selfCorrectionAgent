| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 3.5 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The report also states that the tumor does not involve the chest wall or the skin, so it does not meet the criteria for T3 or T4. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. In the report, the size of the tumor in the right breast is measured as 2.5 cm, which falls under T2 category (T2: The tumor size is more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). Therefore, the T stage for the right breast tumor is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is 3.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The grade of the tumor and the fact that it is poorly differentiated does not affect the T stage. The presence of lymphovascular space invasion, a minimal in-situ component, and extension to within 1 mm of the deep surgical margin also do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, and in this report, the size of the tumor is given as 5.2 cm, which is larger than the threshold for T3 (> 5 cm). The fact that the deep margin is positive for tumor, there are microcalcifications associated with the tumor, and there is perineural involvement by carcinoma do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor size in the left breast is 1.2 cm (gross measurement) and the tumor in the right breast is 1.8 cm (maximum tumor dimension, invasive component, microscopic measurement). The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and does not include information about the lymph nodes. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T1, as the tumor size is less than 2 cm in both breasts. |

| reasoning : The report states that the maximum tumor size is 2.4 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm, and tumor size is determined by microscopy or gross examination. The grade of the tumor (well differentiated) does not affect T stage. Multiple tumors are not mentioned, so the size of the largest tumor is used to determine T stage. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, but the report does not mention any invasion of the chest wall or skin. Surgical margins positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, and microcalcifications identified do not affect T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'tumor dimension (greatest)' is 3.4 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, but the report does not indicate any invasion of the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'TUMOR SIZE: 2.7 CM (MEASURED GROSSLY)' which puts it in the T2 category as per the rules provided. The rules mentioned that tumor size is determined by microscopy or gross examination and it should be measured in centimeters. The report states that the tumor size is measured grossly and it is 2.7 cm which falls in the T2 category. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor, located in the central mass, has a greatest dimension of 2.5 cm. This measurement is taken grossly, and it is the basis for the pathologic T stage. According to the rules provided, T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm, and the T stage does not include information about the lymph nodes. The size of the tumor is measured in centimeters, and tumor ulceration is not mentioned in the report, so it does not affect the T stage. The grade of the tumor is not used to determine the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size in the right breast is 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The presence of isolated tumor cells in the sentinel lymph nodes does not affect the T stage, and the negative surgical margins also do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the 'tumor size (greatest dimension) : 1.9 CM (measured grossly)' and the T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm. The largest tumor size is used to determine the T stage, and in this case, the largest tumor size is 1.9 cm, which falls under T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the maximum tumor size is 3.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm and does not include information about the lymph nodes or the grade of the tumor. The presence of venous/lymphatic invasion, positive surgical margins, perineural involvement, microcalcifications, and isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the largest tumor is 1 cm, which falls under the 'T1' category. The 'T1' category includes tumors that are 2 cm or less in size. There is no mention of the tumor invading the chest wall or skin, so it is not a 'T4' tumor. The tumor size is measured in centimeters, and the size is not based on the grade of the tumor, so the other rules do not affect the T stage in this case. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and does not include information about lymph nodes or other factors such as tumor grade or the presence of carcinoma in lymph nodes. The fact that the tumor is within 1 mm of the anterior margin, there is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) present, and there is no lymphovascular space invasion does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the maximum size of the tumor is 1.4 cm, which falls within the criteria for T1 (tumor size is 2 cm or less). Surgical margins positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications, venous/lymphatic invasion, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, and the presence of in situ carcinoma do not affect T stage. The grade of the tumor is not used to determine T stage either. |

| reasoning : Based on the report, there are two separate tumors in the right breast, both of which are invasive lobular carcinomas with a low nuclear grade. The largest tumor is located in the lower outer quadrant and has a greatest dimension of 1.2 cm, as determined by measuring from the previous biopsy specimen. This measurement puts the tumor in the T1c stage. The second tumor, located in the upper middle quadrant, has a greatest dimension of 1.0 cm, but due to the presence of isolated tumor cells in a section adjacent to the tumor, the exact determination of tumor size is difficult. However, since it is smaller than the largest tumor, it would also fall into the T1 category. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is 2.0 cm, which falls within the range for T1 (tumor size is 2 cm or less). Surgical margins positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications identified, tumor ulceration, tumor grade, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, venous/lymphatic invasion, and the presence of in situ carcinoma do not affect T stage. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage is T1. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. In this report, the tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension, which falls within the T2 category of tumors measuring 'more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm' (rule 2). The close proximity of the tumor to the anterior and posterior surgical margins (less than 1 mm) does not affect the T stage (rule 10). The presence of lymphovascular invasion, microcalcifications, and poor differentiation do not impact the T stage (rules 13, 14, and 7). |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest contiguous focus of the tumor is 1.3 cm. This falls within the range for a T1 tumor, which is 2 cm or less. The presence of venous/lymphatic invasion, multifocality, and positive margins do not affect the T stage, according to the rules provided. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, and in this report, it is stated that the tumor size is 7 cm (greatest overall dimension). According to the rules provided, T1 is for tumors up to 2 cm, T2 is for tumors between 2 cm and 5 cm, and T3 is for tumors larger than 5 cm. Therefore, the tumor size of 7 cm falls under the T3 category. |

| reasoning : The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures. In this report, the tumor measures 10.5 cm in maximum dimension, which falls under T3 category (The tumor size is more than 5 cm). The fact that the tumor involves the chest wall or the skin is not mentioned in the report, so it does not affect the T stage. Also, the surgical margins being positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications identified, tumor ulceration, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, venous/lymphatic invasion, tumor stage being not affected by the presence of in situ carcinoma, the presence of carcinoma in lymph nodes, surgical margin width, or the presence of microcalcifications, all do not apply in this case. |

The T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor, and in this case, the larger tumor is more than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, which corresponds to T2. The fact that there is a smaller tumor present does not affect the T stage, as only the size of the largest tumor is considered. |

| reasoning : The report for the right breast states that the infiltrating lobular carcinoma spans a microscopic distance of 3.3 cm in the upper inner quadrant. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor, and in this case, the tumor size is less than 2 cm (3.3 cm microscopic distance is not equivalent to 3.3 cm physical size). Therefore, the T stage is T1. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor measures 2.6 cm in maximum dimension, which falls within the range for T2 (tumor size > 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, but the report does not mention any invasion of the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 6.6 cm, which falls under the 'T3' category of the TNM staging system for cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm, with T1 being 2 cm or less, T2 being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm, T3 being more than 5 cm, and T4 involving the chest wall or the skin. In this case, the tumor size is 6.6 cm, which is greater than 5 cm, so the T stage is T3. |

| reasoning : The report states that the maximum dimension of the tumor is 4 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and does not include information about lymph node involvement or other factors such as grade or margin width. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report mentions a 'pink-tan gritty area' in the left breast that measures 1.6 x 1.3 x 3.5 cm. This is the largest tumor size mentioned in the report, and it is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, which corresponds to T2. The report also mentions multicentric in situ and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast, but it does not provide enough information to determine if the tumor invades the chest wall or skin (T4) or if it is larger than 5 cm (T3). |

| reasoning : The report states that the invasive tumor is seen in sections from each of the four quadrants on 14 of 17 blocks examined, having a maximum gross dimension of 9 cm. This exceeds the criteria for T3, which is a tumor size of more than 5 cm. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is 13.6 cm, which falls under the 'T4' category of the TNM staging system for cancer. Specifically, 'T4' indicates that the tumor involves the chest wall or the skin. In this case, the report mentions 'focal extension of the tumor into the epidermis without ulceration' and 'the tumor involves the dermis without extension to the epidermis (satellite skin nodule)', which suggests that the tumor has involved the skin. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is 4.7 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The involvement of the surgical margins and the presence of positive lymph nodes do not affect the T stage, so the T stage can be determined solely based on the tumor size. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of a single tumor with an estimated size of 21 mm (or 2.1 cm) in the left breast, which falls under the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and does not include information about lymph nodes or the grade of the tumor. The presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in a random representative section of the lower outer quadrant is likely an extension of the main tumor and does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that there are two tumors, one measuring 1.5 cm and the other measuring 2.2 cm. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, so in this case, the T stage would be T2 because the largest tumor is more than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm. The report states that the tumors are separated by at least 1.5 cm of benign breast tissue, which supports the conclusion that they should be considered as separate tumors for the purpose of determining the T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is 3.2 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The presence of venous/lymphatic invasion, positive surgical margins, and multiple foci of extracapsular extension in lymph nodes do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of two tumors, one in the lower outer quadrant with an estimated size of at least 3 cm (based on previous needle localization biopsies) and one in the upper outer quadrant measuring 2.0 cm (gross). Since the size of the larger tumor is more than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, the T stage is T2. The fact that one of the tumors is poorly differentiated, there are positive surgical margins, and metastasis to 6/10 axillary lymph nodes with extra capsular extension are important factors for determining the overall stage, but they do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of two distinct firm masses in the right breast, one in the 12 o'clock area measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm and the second in the lower outer quadrant measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor, which in this case is the 3.5 cm mass. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is measured as 2.2 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (>2 cm and up to 5 cm). The absence of chest wall or skin involvement, as well as the negative surgical margins, do not affect the T stage. The negative lymph node status and other factors such as tumor grade, necrosis, and receptor status are not considered for T stage determination according to the provided rules. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). This is determined by the greatest dimension measurement in the report, which is 2.5 cm. The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, but in this case, there is no mention of invasion of the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the size of the largest invasive component of the tumor is 40 mm (4 cm). This falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor, which is defined as having a size between 2 cm and 5 cm. The report also mentions that the tumor abuts the deep margin, but this does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm (4 cm). Tumor size is determined by gross examination (23.5 x 21.5 x 3.7 cm specimen with a 4 cm mass). The presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in a random representative section of the lower outer quadrant is likely an extension of the main tumor and not a separate tumor. Satellite nodules throughout all quadrants that are not measured separately as separate primary tumors and appear to have arisen from intramammary lymphatic spread are not considered in determining the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor measures 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (>2 cm and up to 5 cm). The presence of multiple tumors does not affect the T stage, and the size of the largest tumor is used to determine the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor. In this report, the tumor size is documented as 'a grossly focally positive, ill-defined gray-tan mass at 9 o'clock which measures 5.5 cm from medial to lateral, 8 cm from superior to inferior by palpation, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior.' This exceeds the 5 cm threshold for a T3 stage tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest focus of the invasive neoplasm measures 34 mm (3.4 cm) in greatest dimension. This puts the tumor size in the T2 category, as T2 tumors are defined as being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm in size. The report also states that the tumor is present 2 mm from the posterior margin and 5 mm or greater from all other margins, but the T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and does not take into account the distance to the margins. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor measures 5.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The presence of ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, and metastasis to lymph nodes do not affect the T stage, so they are not considered in this prediction. |

| reasoning : The report mentions the presence of multiple invasive tumors in the left breast, with the largest measuring 40 mm (T2) and the second largest measuring 35 mm (which could potentially be T3, as it is larger than 3 cm but the specific measurement in centimeters is not provided). Therefore, the T stage for this report would be either T2 or T3. |

| reasoning : The report states that the largest tumor size is 1.5 cm, which falls within the T1 category of tumor size (2 cm or less). The fact that there are multiple tumors is also considered in determining the T stage, but the size of the largest tumor is still used, which is 1.5 cm in this case. |

| reasoning : The report states that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 3.3 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The report also states that the tumor does not involve the chest wall or the skin, which are factors that would increase the T stage. Additionally, the report does not mention any other factors that would affect the T stage, such as multiple tumors or venous/lymphatic invasion. |

| reasoning : Based on the information provided in the pathology report, the largest tumor size is in the left breast and measures at least 1.5 cm, which falls under the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The report states that the tumor size is 'no less than 1.5 cm' in the left breast, indicating that it is at least this size but may be larger. However, without a more precise measurement, we can only conclude that the tumor is a T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 3.0 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor in cm and does not include information about the lymph nodes or the grade of the tumor. The presence of carcinoma in lymph nodes or venous/lymphatic invasion does not affect T stage. Tumor ulceration is also not a factor in determining T stage. Surgical margins positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications, and isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes do not affect T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor measures 5.5 cm, which falls under the 'T3' category of the T stage classification: 'T3: The tumor size is more than 5 cm.' (rule 2). This measurement is based on the size of the largest tumor, as there are multiple tumors present (rule 8). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, such as the chest wall or skin. In this case, there is no mention of the tumor involving the chest wall or the skin (rules 6, 9), so the T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor. |

| reasoning : The report states that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 1.8 cm, which falls within the range for T1 (2 cm or less). The report also mentions that the tumor invades the inferior margin, but this does not affect the T stage. Surgical margins positive for tumor also do not affect T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 2.3 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (>2 cm and up to 5 cm). The report also states that there is no involvement of the skin or chest wall, which is not considered in determining the T stage. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is 1.3 cm, which falls within the range for T1 (tumor size is 2 cm or less). Surgical margins positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications, venous/lymphatic invasion, tumor ulceration, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, and tumor stage are not considered in determining T stage for this cancer type according to the provided rules. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the size of the invasive lobular carcinoma in the right breast is 2.6 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The fact that the tumor extends to involve the inferior and lateral margins does not affect the T stage, as the T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures such as the chest wall or skin. The presence of isolated cytokeratin positive cells in the sentinel lymph node (pNOi+) does not affect the T stage, as the T stage does not include information about the lymph nodes. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the largest tumor is 2.2 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The presence of negative surgical margins, venous/lymphatic invasion, and isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and invasion of nearby structures. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the invasive lobular carcinoma is 7.5 cm, which falls under the 'T3' category of the TNM staging system for breast cancer. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, such as the chest wall or skin. In this case, the tumor size is the primary factor in determining T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the greatest dimension of the tumor is 4.3 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The report also states that the tumor does not involve the chest wall or the skin, which are factors considered in T4 stage. Therefore, based on the information provided, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the largest tumor is 3.2 cm, which falls within the range for T2 (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The fact that the surgical margins are close does not affect the T stage. Similarly, the absence of venous/lymphatic invasion, tumor ulceration, and isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes does not impact the T stage. The presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma and microcalcifications also do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor, with T1 being 2 cm or less. In this report, the tumor size is measured as 1.7 cm, which falls within the T1 category. The 'c' subclassification indicates that the tumor is between 1 and 2 cm in size. Surgical margins, perineural involvement, microcalcifications, and venous/lymphatic invasion do not affect T stage. The presence of in situ carcinoma and carcinoma in lymph nodes also do not affect T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor in the right breast is 4.5 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumor size being more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The fact that the tumor involves the chest wall or the skin is not mentioned, so we cannot assign a T4 stage. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ and the grade of the tumor do not affect the T stage. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the maximum microscopic tumor diameter is 1.5 cm, which falls within the range for T1 tumors (2 cm or less). The report also mentions 'pT1c(m)', which confirms that the T stage is T1. The 'm' in 'pT1c(m)' indicates multifocal tumors, but for T stage, only the size of the largest tumor matters. The presence of multiple ulcerations, skin involvement, and close resection margins do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is 5.5 cm, which falls in the T3 category (maximum diameter more than 5 cm and not invading the chest wall or skin). This is based on the rule that tumor size is the primary factor in determining T stage, with additional consideration given to invasion of nearby structures such as the chest wall or skin. The size of the tumor is determined by microscopy or gross examination. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the maximum diameter of the tumor is 2.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The report also mentions that the tumor is invasive ductal breast carcinoma, but it does not provide any information about invasion of nearby structures such as the chest wall or skin. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The tumor diameter is 8 cm, which falls under the 'T3' category of the T stage classification (T3: The tumor size is more than 5 cm and has not invaded the chest wall or skin). The report also mentions that the distance to the dorsal resection margin is less than 0.1 cm, but surgical margins positive for tumor do not affect T stage. Therefore, the T stage is determined solely by the tumor size. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor diameter is 2.2 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The fact that the tumor is poorly differentiated and invasive ductal carcinoma, as well as the presence of focal angioinvasion, does not affect the T stage determination. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor has invaded the skin ('focal ulceration of the skin') which is a characteristic of T4 stage. The size of the largest tumor focus is 7 cm, which is also consistent with T4 stage. The grade of the tumor (G III) and the presence of angioinvasion, focal ulceration, and multifocality do not affect the T stage according to the rules provided. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor diameter is 3.0 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The tumor grade (G III) and other factors such as surgical margins, perineural involvement, microcalcifications, venous/lymphatic invasion, and in situ carcinoma do not affect the T stage, as per the provided rules. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor diameter is 3.5 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 2 cm and up to 5 cm). The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and does not include information about lymph nodes or the grade of the tumor. The presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma or satellite nodules does not affect the T stage. The surgical margins being positive for tumor, perineural involvement by carcinoma, microcalcifications, venous/lymphatic invasion, and the width of the surgical margin also do not affect the T stage. |

The moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma classification and the presence of an intraductal component do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based solely on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, and in this case, there is no mention of invasion of the chest wall or skin. Therefore, the T stage for this patient is T2. |

| reasoning : The largest tumor focus is measured at 2.6 cm, which falls within the T2 category of tumors with a size of more than 2 cm and up to 5 cm. The presence of multifocal tumors and intraductal components, as well as the involvement of nearby structures such as the skeletal muscle, do not affect the T stage. The grade of the tumor (G III) is also not used to determine the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates a bifocal invasive ductal carcinoma with tumor diameters of 3.0 cm and 0.8 cm. Since the larger tumor size is 3.0 cm, which is more than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, the T stage is T2. The report also mentions focal intraductal components, G II, and NOS, but these factors do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 2.2 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (>20 mm and up to 50 mm). The fact that the tumor is poorly differentiated, invasive ductal carcinoma, and has surgical margins that are almost 1 cm basally and at 6 o'clock, and surrounding fibrolipomatous atrophic glandular tissue without any evidence of an intraductal tumor component and tumor-free overlying skin, including the nipple, does not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is given as 3 cm (30 mm) in the report, which falls within the range for T2 (> 20 mm and up to 50 mm). The report also mentions that the tumor is moderately differentiated and invasive ductal breast carcinoma, but these factors do not affect the T stage. The absence of invasion of the lymph or blood vessels, the clear surgical margins, and the presence of multifocal intraductal non-high-grade carcinoma are also not relevant to the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor size is more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm (pT2), as determined by microscopy or gross examination. The presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in a random representative section of the lower outer quadrant is likely an extension of the main tumor and not a separate tumor. Satellite nodules throughout all quadrants that are not measured separately as separate primary tumors and appear to have arisen from intramammary lymphatic spread are not considered in determining the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the largest tumor has a diameter of 2.3 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 20 mm and up to 50 mm). The fact that the tumor is bifocal, with a second tumor measuring 2 cm, does not change the T stage as the T stage is based on the size of the largest tumor. |

The other factors mentioned in the report, such as the high differentiation grade and the presence of intraductal components, do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report provides the tumor diameter, which is 3.5 cm. According to the rules, T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm. The actual measurement of 3.5 cm falls within this range, so the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 1.7 cm, which falls under the 'T1' category of the TNM staging system for cancer, as it is 20 mm or less. The well differentiation (G1) of the tumor, the absence of venous/lymphatic invasion (pV0), and the carcinoma-free resection margins do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the size of the largest tumor is 2.8 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 20 mm and up to 50 mm). The fact that there are multiple foci of carcinoma does not affect the T stage, as the size of the largest tumor is used to determine this. Additionally, the tumor grade (G III) and the presence of infiltrating lobular carcinoma or satellite nodules do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor measures a maximum of 6 cm, which falls within the size range for T3 (> 50 mm and has not invaded the chest wall or skin). The report mentions focal invasion of the lymph vessels, extension to the base of the nipple, and the pectoral muscle, but these do not affect the T stage as they are related to invasion of nearby structures, not tumor size. |

| reasoning : The maximum microscopic tumor diameter is 4.0 cm, which falls within the range for T3 (tumor size > 50 mm and not invaded the chest wall or skin). The report mentions 'massive subepidermal carcinomatous lymphangitis of the skin spindle' but does not indicate chest wall or skin invasion, so T3 is the appropriate stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor diameter is 5.0 cm, which is larger than the 50 mm cutoff for T3. The report also mentions that the tumor involves the skin spindle, which is consistent with a T4 designation. The presence of ulceration and focal angioinvasion do not affect the T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor diameter is 2.7 cm, which is larger than 20 mm and up to 50 mm, corresponding to a T2 stage. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and does not include information about the lymph nodes or the grade of the tumor. The presence of isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, venous/lymphatic invasion, and in situ carcinoma do not affect T stage. |

| reasoning : The report states that the tumor diameter is 2.2 cm, which is larger than the 2 cm cutoff for T2. The fact that the tumor is poorly differentiated, invasive, and has focal in situ spread does not affect the T stage. The presence of neuroendocrine characteristics also does not affect the T stage. Surgical margins, perineural involvement, microcalcifications, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes, venous/lymphatic invasion, and the presence of in situ carcinoma do not affect the T stage. Therefore, based on the size of the tumor, the T stage is T2. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor is a highly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with a tumor diameter of 2.7 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm. The tumor size of 2.7 cm falls within this range, so the T stage is T2. |

According to the rules provided, T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm. Even though the tumor size is larger than 50 mm, it has not invaded the chest wall or skin, so it does not meet the criteria for T3 or T4. |

| reasoning : The report states that the maximum diameter of the invasive ductal breast carcinoma is 1.8 cm, which falls under the 'T1' category in the TNM staging system for cancer. The 'T' stage is determined by the size of the tumor in mm, and in this case, the tumor size is less than 20 mm. |

| reasoning : The reported tumor size is 105 cm (10500 mm), which exceeds the maximum size for T3 (> 50 mm) and falls into the T4 category. The presence of ulceration and satellite nodules in the skin also support a T4 classification. However, the specific subcategory of T4 (T4a, T4b, T4c, or T4d) cannot be determined without additional information about the involvement of the chest wall or skin. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor size is 3 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm). The tumor is also described as poorly differentiated and invasive ductal carcinoma, but the grade of the tumor is not used to determine the T stage. The tumor classification NOS, G II, pT2LOVORO also suggests that the tumor is a T2 stage. |

| reasoning : The tumor size is reported as 3.5 cm, which is larger than the 50 mm threshold for T3. The tumor is also reported to involve the skin (pT4b), which is a requirement for T4 staging. Therefore, the T stage for this report is T4. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 55 mm, which falls under the 'T3: The tumor size is more than 50 mm and has not invaded the chest wall or skin.' category. However, the report also states that the tumor involves the skin ('pT4b'), which overrides the T3 category and places the tumor in the T4 category. Therefore, the T stage from this report is T4. |

| reasoning : The report indicates that the tumor diameter is 5.5 cm, which falls in the T3 category (tumor size is more than 50 mm and has not invaded the chest wall or skin). This is because the T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby structures, such as the chest wall or skin. The tumor size is determined by microscopy or gross examination, and it should be measured in the largest dimension to determine T stage. In this case, the largest dimension of the tumor is 5.5 cm, which is more than 50 mm and therefore places the tumor in the T3 category. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is up to 4.4 cm, which falls within the range for a T2 stage tumor (> 20 mm and up to 50 mm). The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and the measurement of the tumor in three dimensions (up to 4.4 cm) rather than the largest dimension do not affect the T stage determination. |

| reasoning : The report states that the size of the tumor is 1.4 cm, which falls under the T1 category of tumor size being 20 mm or less (1 cm = 10 mm). The other T stage rules do not apply to this report, as they refer to specific factors that are not mentioned in the report, such as invasion of the chest wall or skin, or multiple tumors. |

| reasoning : The T stage is based on the size of the tumor, and in this report, the tumor measures approximately 4.3 cm. According to the rules provided, T2 corresponds to a tumor size of more than 20 mm and up to 50 mm. Although the report mentions invasion of the lymph vessels and a minimum margin, these factors do not affect the T stage. |
