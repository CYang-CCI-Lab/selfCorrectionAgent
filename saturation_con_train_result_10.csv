Gross Description: M.D. M.D. 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, ""right breast and axillary. contents level 1"",. It consists of a breast with attached. axillary contents. The breast measures 20 x 15 x 5 cm with overlying skin. ellipse measuring 18 x 7 x 0.2 cm. Situated centrally on the skin surface is. a. fixed, and retracted nipple measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The surrounding. skin is markedly thickened (up to 0.6 cm) . A suture demarcates the axillary. contents which measures 7 x 5 x 2 cm. The posterior surface of the breast is. inked black and the anterior blue. Part of the posterior surface of the. breast is covered by dark red skeletal muscle, measuring 11 x 4 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular tumor bed (10 x. 8.3 x 5.1 cm) with poorly defined white, firm and tan areas. The tumor bed. occupies almost the entire breast volume, extending throughout all four. quadrants. The tumor bed is located 0.2 cm from the posterior margin, 0.3 cm. from the anterior margin, and 0.5 cm from the skeletal muscle. The remaining. breast tissue shows yellow fatty areas with foci of fibrosis. The axillary. tissue is dissected to reveal 13 possible lymph nodes, ranging in size from. 0.4 cm to 1.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted. All dissected lymph. nodes are entirely submitted. The specimen is photographed. Tissue is. submitted to TPS.
