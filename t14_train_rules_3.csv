Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HER-Z/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (. was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this specimen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for. both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy. for chromosome 17.

The nipple is. surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away from. the nipple is a poorly defined, slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7. X 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large. mechanical defect, measuring 5 X 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears. to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and. the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly. circumscribed, tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 X 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring. 2.5 X 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately. 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node, measuring. 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is identified.

There is a short stitch designated as superior and a long. stitch designated as lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior superior blue, anterior inferior. green, and posterior black. Prior to receipt by me (Dr. the posterior portion of the. breast has been incised and tissue removed for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned,. from medial to lateral, into eight slices and reveals a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule (1.5 x 1 x. 0.9 cm) in slices 3 through 6. The tumor nodule is located approximately 1 cm from both the lateral-. and medial-most margins, 0.7 cm from the superior margin, and 1.3 cm from the inferior margin. The. closest approach to a margin is in slice 6, where it appears to abut the anterior-mid portion of the. specimen (<1 mm grossly from the blue/green-inked margin).

There is strong nuclear staining in ~50% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is weak to moderate nuclear staining in ~15%. of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block F6 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3.

Invasive adeno carcinoma of breast. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast biopsy (AF1)"". in formalin. The specimen consists of an. irregular ovoid fragment of firm pink and yellow-tan tissue measuring 2 x 1.5. x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen has been previously. submitted as frozen section AF1, and portion of tissue has been previously. submitted for ER/PR evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in. Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This is. located more centrally but in the lower outer quadrant. The larger firm mass. surrounding the biopsy cavity to within approximately 0.5 cm of the surgical. margin but the fibroadipose tissue on the deep surface is easily clear over. the lesions.

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a pMx. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner. quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose. tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ. and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1. mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is. possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted posterior. margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is. the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two. masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma. in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an. intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and. HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two. masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and. the results will be reported in an addendum. Gross Description: Specimen A is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""left re-excision. posterior margin, tumor clip posterior"" and is a partially oriented 2.6 x 1.8 x. 1.0 cm fragment of mainly brown/red muscle with some minimal adherent. fibroadipose tissue. There is a clip on one surface indicating the margin. This. surface is inked blue. The remainder of the specimen is inked black. Sectioning exhibits unremarkable red/brown muscle with minimal fibroadipose. tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks A1. and A2. Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""right total. mastectomy, stitch marks axillary tail"". Specimen fixation: Formalin. Time in fixative: 7 hours. Type of mastectomy: Total, per the specimen container and requisition. Size of specimen: 300 grams, 19 x 15.5 x 3.0 cm. Orientation of specimen: There is a stitch marking axillary tail. At. the time of tissue procurement triage, the specimen is inked as follows: anterior/green, posterior/purple, axillary tail (lateral)/yellow. Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.5 x 4.2 cm.

Comment: The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved. The control slides for this case show. appropriate staining. The patient' S larger tumor was sampled and tested previously, which showed a similar. pattern of immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu. Subsequent in situ. hybridization studies for HER-2/neu gene amplification on that specimen showed that the. tumor was positive for Her-2/neu gene amplification. In situ hybridization studies can be. repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako. following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunoristochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. I. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A8. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. 1. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 381 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this. orientation, the specimen measures 16 cm from medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 4. cm from anterior to posterior. There is an overlying ellipse of tan skin measuring 11.8 x 7 cm. The areola. measures 3.3 cm and the nipple appears slightly inverted. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin. which consists variably of smooth facial. appearing tissue and lobulated fatty tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned along the. superior-inferior axis resulting in fifteen slabs. Slab #1 is most medial. In the central portion of the excision, in slabs 6-9, there is a stellate hard, gritty neoplasm (tumor #1) which. overall measures 4 cm from medial to lateral, 1.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 1 cm from anterior to. posterior. This neoplasm is 1.5 cm from the closest skin. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin. and is greater than 4 cm from all other margins. Representative sections of the medial portion of the tissue. are obtained for research purposes and the biopsy site clip is identified within the neoplasm in slab 7. Slab 10 (intervening tissue between tumor #1 and tumors #2 and #3) consists of palpably unremarkable. fibrofatty tissue. In slab 11, 1 cm lateral to the tumor #1, there is chalky yellow discoloration and slight retraction of the. fibrofatty tissue suggestive of two small deposits of neoplastic tissue. The larger of these (tumor #2) is 8 cm. lateral to the nipple. It measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.6 cm and is greater than 2 cm from the anterior-superior,. anterior-inferior, and posterior margins. It is 2.3 cm from the closest lateral margin and widely free of the. medial margin. The smaller tumor deposit (tumor #3) measures 0,5 cm and is 0.8 cm superior of the larger deposit in slab. 11. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin and greater than 2 cm from all other margins. No. other palpable lesions are identified.

There is an overlying broad ellipse of tan skin which measures 12 x 7 cm. In the lateral skin, there is a 0.4 cm violaceous skin lesion. Centrally, there is a well-delineated 4 cm. areola and a flat to slightly retracted appearing 1 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue,. the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of lobulated fatty. tissue, with central fascial appearing tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close. intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white fibrous parenchyma which is most. prominent centrally. The fibrous parenchyma is focally finely nodular to palpation but there are no. discrete areas suggestive of invasive neoplasm. There are scattered small fluid-filled cysts within the. fibrous parenchyma. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted.
