PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen. Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 0.88 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 41% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.0. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH. Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with.

Histologic sections from the 9.5 cm mass demonstrates a moderately. differentiated adenocarcinoma with a heterogenous appearance. In. areas, the cells are tall columnar with areas of necrosis. In other. areas prominent mucinous differentiation is seen with features. morphologically suggestive of bronchial alveolar type. A limited. panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed with working. controls and demonstrates the cells to be positive for TTF1 and CK7. and negative for CK20. These findings support the diagnosis of. primary lung malignancy. An elastin stain is performed with working controls and highlights. rare neoplastic cells extending into but not entirely through the. elastic layer; however, based on size this is best classified as a. pT3. A total of 22 lymph nodes are identified including all parts, six of. which contain metastatic carcinoma.

ROS Methodology Description: ROS translocation detection is as follows: Normal cells without the ROS translocation show green and red signals in juxtaposition. Cells with the ROS translocation show one pair of signals (green and red) in juxtaposition and one green and one red signal. separated. ROS FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the ROS. Texas Red (centromeric) and the ROS FITC(telomeric) probes. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Molecular Anatomic Pathology Procedure. Interpretation. MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING: Block 15C: A. KRAS codon 12 mutation IDENTIFIED (p.G12C, c.34G>T). B. KRAS codon 61 mutation NOT identified. C. EGFR exon 18 mutation NOT identified. D. EGFR exon 19 mutation NOT identified. E. EGFR exon 20 mutation NOT identified. F. EGFR exon 21 mutation NOT identified. G. BRAF codon 600 mutation NOT identified. NOTE: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. BACKGROUND: EGFR mutations are present in about 10-15% of non-Asian and up to 40% of the Asian patients with non-small-cell lung. cancer (NSCLC) (1,2). They are more frequent in non-smokers, females, and in tumors with adenocarcinoma histology. Activating EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions, exon 21 point mutations (L858R, L861Q), and exon 18 G719A/C/S. point mutation are associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (gefitinib,. erlotinib) (2-4). Advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations show response rates of more than 70%, with. progression-free survival up to 14 month (2,3). However, EGFR mutations in exon 20 (insertions and T790M point. mutation) are associated with acquired resistance to TKIs (4). KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are found in. approximately 30% and 2% of lung adenocarcinomas respectively. The most common mutation types are KRAS codon. 12/13 and BRAF V600E. Patients with these mutations tend to be resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib (2,5,6). However,. not all tumors reveal such a correlation and, therefore, the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in. conjunction with other laboratory and cilnical findings. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target or more than 300 cells for FNA specimen were. accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of. mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene and exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and. reverse sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130. The sequencing electropherograms were. analyzed for the presence of mutations. The method sensitivity is approximately 20% of mutant alleles in a background of normal DNA. For. detection of BRAF mutation, real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601 sequences. Post-PCR. melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR. product on ABI3130. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA. In Situ Procedure. Interpretation. PROBE: LSI ALK Dual-Color Break-apart Probe 2p23.

These are sections of lymph node characterized by. moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of. involvement by tumor. C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor. (slides 5 and 6 ), composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding. pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli,. associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described. mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed, but non-encapsulated, nodular mass,. composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped. nuclei, arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin. with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The. grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the. subpleural alveolar architecture, associated with irregular fibrous thickening. of the pleura, which is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes and plasma cells, forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters. of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli, most notably. within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is. identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated,. pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The. vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph. node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no. morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. D. One slide is examined, including the entirely submitted specimen. These. are sections of a biopsy portion of lung, composed of benign alveolar. parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue, consistent with parietal. pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is. identified. E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing. fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally. present within the clot, occasionally forming gland-like structures. No lymph. node is identified within the entirely submitted specimen. SPECIAL STAINS: A. section of tumor (block A1) is stained by the immunoperoxidase method for. thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). The tumor cells reveal weak to. moderate intranuclear positivity, consistent with lung primary. A section of. block E is also stained for TTF -1. The clusters of cells morphologically. interpreted as mesothelial cells, are negative by this stain. Also stained is. a section of the spindle cell tumor, seen on block C3, within the completion. lobectomy specimen. The cells comprising the lesion are strongly and.

On sectioning, there are five lymph nodes within the tissue,. the largest measuring 26 X 12 X 10 mm. [Large lymph node, 3A-C; 1 lymph node bisected, 3D; 2. lymph nodes bisected, 3E]. 4: The specimen is labelled 'upper medial sternal node (right)' and consists of a piece of fatty tissue. containing a lymph node measuring 20 X 9 x 10 mm. [Bisected and BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. In areas, there is production of. abundant mucin by the tumour cells. A small micropapillary component is identified. Numerous. psammoma bodies are identified within the tumour. The lesion is arising in the region of the hilum and. is invading into soft tissue around bronchi and large pulmonary vessels. A separate deposit measuring. 1.4 mm is identified in the random sections from the lower lobe and there is a deposit measuring 0.7. mm in diameter in the random sections from the middle lobe. Carcinoma is identified in the random. sections from the upper lobe but this is in a lymphangitis carcinomatosa pattern. Pleural invasion is not. identified. There is no blood vessel invasion but there is prominent lymphatic permeation is seen. No. perineural permeation is identified. Lymphatic permeation by carcinoma is identified within the. lamina propria of the bronchial resection margin. Tumour approaches the hilar resection margin. In. most areas carcinoma is separated from hilar tissues that in visceral pleura but in some areas the lung. has been transected. In one area in particular, tumour is approximately 0.5 mm from the diathermied. margin. Peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. All the lymph node Cross sections appear to. contain at least some tumour and there is lymphatic permeation within the surrounding soft tissue.

Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any. sequence. changes that could result in amino acid changes. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of. EGFR gene, a negative result does not preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors.

INTERPRETATION : FISH RESULT NEGATIVE FOR REARRANGEMENT OF ALK GENE, SUGGESTIVE OF GAIN OF ALK REGION. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using break-apart probes specific for ALK gene (2p23; Abbott Molecular), did not exhibit a break-apart. pattern. Thus, this result is not indicative of a translocation involving the ALK gene. As. an incidental finding, additional 1-8 copies of the ALK region were observed in 79% of cells. This suggests gain of the ALK region. The clinical. significance of this incidental finding is unknown. A small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated by other methods may be missed by this study. This result does not rule out a malignancy or other genetic changes. This result should be considered in combination with other clinical and/or laboratory. data. The cutoff values for ALK rearrangement are 12% for paraffin-embedded specimens, 3% for bone marrow, 5% for peripheral blood. Please expect. the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report. This test was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by. has. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA nas determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. Laboratory results reviewed and Clinical Interpretation provided by. Test performed and reported under supervision of. Mutational analysis of the EGFR and KRAS genes and ALK locus rearrangement by FISH were performed to survey the most common tumor-associated. genetic changes that have been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic consequences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR kinase domain mutations are found in 10-15% of lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those occurring in younger patients without a smoking. history,. and. identify. tumors. that may have significant clinical response to EGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors. Secondary somatic mutations in EGFR, particularly. T790M in exon 20, may accompany acquired resistance to these inhibitors. KRAS point mutations occur in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinomas and are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations are. associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-EGFR-directed immunotherapy. ALK. locus rearrangement resulting in the EML4-ALK gene fusion is present in 3-5% of NSCLC, is most commonly seen in adenocarcinomas from. younger patients, and produces overexpression of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Patients who harbor ALK rearrangement do not benefit from EGFR tyrosine. kinase inhibitors and are recommended to be directed to trials of ALK-targeted agents. The. exons tested cumulatively comprise greater than 95% of the known activating mutations in the selected genes; rare mutations occurring at other sites. or in other genes that may influence outcome cannot be excluded. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tissue sections isolated from the submitted block. PCR-based DNA sequencing. was. used to assess for mutations in exon 1 (including codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (including codon 61) of KRAS and exons 18-21 of the EGFR. tyrosine. kinase. (TK) domain. The sensitivity for mutation detection for these assays is approximately 10% mutant allele in the background of normal. allele. in. the. microdissected area. The KRAS and EGFR test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. The FISH test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. It. has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

COMMENTS: Appropriately controlled immunohistochemical stains for pancytokeratin performed on block C2 shows numerous positive tumor cells in lymph nodes. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to help select patients for. Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Lung. Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobe'. It. consists of two irregular portions of grey and tan-yellow rubbery to. firm tissue measuring 1 X 0.8 X 0.5 cm and 1.1 X 0.9 X 0.6 cm. Entirely submitted to. 2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right level 11 lymph. node'. It consists of a 1.8 X 1.5 X 0.8 cm aggregate of black soft. rubbery anthracotic lymphoid tissue. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobe'. It. consists of a 174 gram, 14.5 X 10 X 3 cm right lower lobe of the. lung. At the hilum, a 2.5 cm diameter, 0.3 cm long portion of. bronchus and large vessels are noted. The lung is previously. incised through its visceral pleural surface revealing a 4 X 3.5 X. 2.5 cm poorly-circumscribed, firm, tan tumor with central tan-white. necrosis deep to the overlying puckered pleura. The overlying. pleura is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned along. the long axis of the lobe. The tumor abuts the pleural surface and. is approximately 0.2 cm from the vascular margin and 0.6 cm from the. bronchial margin. There is also an ill-defined, patchy tan-yellow. area that extends from the tumor to the superior portion of the lobe. and terminates in two firm tan-yellow nodules measuring 1.0 cm and. 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. The uninvolved pleural surface is. smooth, glistening and tan-red. The uninvolved pulmonary parenchyma. is homogeneous, tan-pink and aerated. Representative sections of. the specimen are submitted. 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 11 lymph node. near right upper lobe'.

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750del5 mutation in Exon 19. INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the. LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell. lung carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. E746 A750dell5 corresponds to 2235 2249del15. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene.

The second nodule, which. is more apically situated, has its epicenter about 2 cm away from. the lesion mentioned above and has more of a yellowish cut surface,. is well circumscribed and up to 1.8 x 1.7 cm and presents focally. just beneath the pleural surface, also with some overlying puckering. of plerua. A portion of this tumor is also sampled for the tumor. genome project. After preparation of the frozen section, the frozen section remnant. is placed in a block and the remainder of the tissue is fixed prior. to further processing. After fixation of the specimen, the frozen section control is. processed as block FSA1. Additional tissues in the region of the. vascular and bronchial margins are taken after removing staples, in. block A2, which include apparent vascular margins, additional. bronchial tissue and parabronchial lymph nodes. The more lateral. tumor site is then sampled as multiple pieces in blocks A3 and A4,. including overlying puckered pleural surfaces. A5. This is a vertical section taken between the two foci of. tumors, which appears to be free of gross tumor. This section will. let us know whether there is direct connection between the nodules. or not, on a microscopic level. A6-A7. More apical, second focus and overlying puckered pleural. surface. Upon further inspecting the specimen after fixation, the two foci of. tumors appear to be fairly close together, perhaps as close as 5 mm,. and may be continuous as a ""dumbbell"" fashion if connected. A. section of uninvolved lung tissue from the lower aspect of the lobe. is taken as block A8. B. ""R4 lymph node. A mostly dark black and focally yellow piece. of tissue is 1.4 x 1.2 x up to 0.5 cm. It is bisected. C. ""Subcarinal lymph node. "" Three pieces of jet black tissue are. from 4, 9 and 16 mm across. Only the largest is bisected but all. material is then processed as one block. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. A. Bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. MICROSCOPIC. A. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings. of a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. The two foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and. the more atypically situated have identical histology with areas. showing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue with some areas. showing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas. having more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm. Some of the latter. tumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral. pleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the. outside of the visceral pleura. Deeper sections have been. made of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules,. although not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of. additional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a. connection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules. Thus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape. and both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of. clear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm. Emphysema is. also found within the lung. A focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel,. probably a vein. A single parabronchial lymph node is found and is. negative for metastatic disease. B. The lymph node is studied at multiple cuts through the node and. is enlarged and has reactive changes, but does not contain. metastatic disease. C. The lymph node is enlarged, has reactive changes and is negative. for metastatic disease. The case is seen by Dr. who is in agreement with the. following diagnoses. DIAGNOSIS. A. Right upper lung lobe, biopsy with frozen section: Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CPT 88307, 88331. Parabronchial lymph node negative for metastatic disease. CPT 88305. B.

The remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted labeled B-D. Container labeled. 2 - right lower lobe wedge #2"". is a previously sectioned partially fragmented wedge shaped portion. of recognizable pulmonary parenchyma weighing as received 22 grams. and on reconstruction measures approximately 5.7 X 4.2 x 3.0 cm. the closed staple line is the margin of resection. The pleura is. wrinkled gray pink with an eccentric 2.5 X 2.5 cm plaque like area. of tan gray discoloration and umbilication noted 0.8 cm from the. nearest staple line margin. This is sectioned to reveal a well. defined lobulated gritty gray tan fibrotic lesion with focally. anthracotic gritty gray tan fibrotic cut surface measuring 2.7 x 2.5. x 2.0 cm. This grossly extends to but not through the pleura. The. remaining parenchyma is spongy and pink red. The portion submitted. for frozen section is reported as ""adenocarcinoma"" reported to Dr. ositive patient ID, by Dr. In addition, there. are three tissue cassettes within the specimen container labeled. The frozen residue is submitted labeled A. The. remaining lesion and surrounding tissue is submitted labeled B-H. Representative remaining parenchyma is submitted labeled I-J. Container labeled. 3 - right upper lobe wedge"". has a 15 gram wedge shaped portion of recognizable pulmonary. parenchyma with a closed staple line as the margin of resection. The specimen is 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm. The pleura is slightly wrinkled. pink red with marked anthracotic streaking and a few areas of. apparent plaque like thickening up to 0.8 cm which are poorly. defined. On sectioning in the central portion of the specimen there. is an intraparenchymal 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm lobulated gray tan. fibrotic nodular lesion noted 0.4 cm from the nearest staple line. margin. This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut surface. The. remaining parenchyma is spongy congested and markedly anthracotic. streaked with moderate honeycombing. The specimen is step sectioned. and entirely submitted in 10 cassettes.

Container labeled. 5 - level 7 lymph node"" are. 4.0 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm partially fragmented lobulated portion of fleshy. gray black tissue with a slightly mottled fleshy gray black cut. surface. This is received along with 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm of similar. irregular tissue fragments. The largest portion is sectioned and. submitted labeled A-E while the smaller portion is entirely. submitted labeled F. Microscopic Description: Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in. areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend. into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a. dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The. neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface. Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3. show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different. growth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have. irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic. cytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei. Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the. right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right. lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 and. negative for CK20. Some of the cells are strongly positive for. TTF1. These are in the more glandular areas. The more solid areas. are negative for this marker. The more solid areas do express. positivity for CDX-2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative. for this marker. The cells are negative for p63. This staining. pattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary. origin. It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the. colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right. upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for. both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. The. cells are strongly positive for p63. This staining pattern would. support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly. differentiated. The immunohistochemical control slides stain. appropriately. Final Diagnosis. Right lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section: Negative for carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in saline, in five parts, each labeled with. the patient's name. 1. Part one is labeled 'basilar segment left lower lobe, stitch. marks tumor'. It consists of a segmentectomy specimen of the lung. measuring 15 X 10 X 4 cm. The staple line measures 8 cm in length. which is shaved and the parenchyma around is inked black. The. specimen is received precut and the precut area is marked with a. stitch which reveals a gray-pink slightly firm nodule measuring 1.5. X 1.2 cm. The nodule is located subpleural and 3 cm from the hilum. The pleura is gray-pink, glistening and lightly mottled with fine. black streaks. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red, blotchy. and crepitant. Representative sections are submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'level 11 lymph node left'. It consists of. one anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.8 X 0.6 X 0.3 cm. Entire. lymph node is submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is labeled 'level 5 lymph node left'. It consists of. one anthracotic lymph node measuring 1 x 0.8 X 0.5 cm. Entire lymph. node is submitted in one cassette. 4. Part four is labeled 'level 6 lymph node left'. It consists of. one lymph node measuring 0.6 X 0.5 X 0.3 cm. Entire lymph node is. submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It consists of one. anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.3 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm. Entire lymph. node is submitted in one cassette.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent. 0. 2 for. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13. of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: G. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750del5 mutation in Exon 19. INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the. LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non-small-cell lung. carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. E746 A750del5 corresponds to 236 2250dell5. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION. Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES:"

Four specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe' and consists of a left lower lobe of lung measuring. 160 (SI) X 100 (AP) X 90 mm (ML). The pleural surface is puckered on the anteromedial aspect of the. superior portion of the lobe and underlying this there is a firm mass. This has been incised prior to. reception in the laboratory. Otherwise the pleural surface is unremarkable. There are two suture lines. extending from the hilum. One extends superiorly and measures 40 mm the other inferiorly and. measures 35 mm. Sectioning reveals a large poorly circumscribed tumour mass underlying the area of. pleural puckering described. Defining its dimensions macroscopically is difficult but it would be. approximately 70 (SI) X 60 (AP) X 70 mm (ML). It is made difficult as the tumour merges. imperceptibly with probable endogenous lipoid pneumonia in the surrounding parenchyma. The. tumour mass extends from the anterior pleural surface to the posterior pleural surface and extends to. within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. A discrete firm nodule is noted in the mid lateral. portion of the lobe which measures 5 X 5 X 5 mm. This appears to be separate from the main tumour.

Sectioning reveals only lymph node. [Bisected, BIT, 2A.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""No. 9 lymph node' and consists of a piece of nodal tissue measuring. 33 x 15 x 17 mm. [Trisected, BIT, 3A-3B.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 10 lymph node' and consists of a single piece of nodal tissue. measuring 24 x 14 x 14 mm. [Bisected, BIT, 4A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1. Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a papillary architecture. and includes areas with psammoma bodies and ""Orphan Annie' nuclei. There is a small component. with features of micropapillary differentiation. Although this may represent a lung primary, special. stains are being performed to exclude a thyroid or an ovarian primary. Surrounding the mass, there is a. patchy lepidic growth pattern and carcinoma is identified both within the airspaces and lymphatics in. the section from the normal lung. The nodule in the mid lateral portion of the lobe is a focus of tumour. with a surrounding lepidic growth pattern. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour invades into the. visceral pleural surface. There is possible focal surface involvement. Blood vessel and lymphatic. invasion is present. No perineural permeation is seen. Adenocarcinoma is present within all the. peribronchial lymph nodes including one at the bronchial resection margin. Extracapsular extension is. noted. Also present at the bronchial resection margin, there is lymphatic permeation within the. mucosa. No dysplasia is seen.

Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3. M 8255/3 G3. Comment/supplementary remark: Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the. parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component,. which has a partly clear-cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main. tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and. bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident. on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive. confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a. late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the. fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural. surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility. cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and. the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection preparation of parietal. pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor-free. Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double. expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular. differentiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1. The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed. differentiation."

Tumor classification according to these findings pT2 pN1 V2 RX,. stage IIB. C34.2; M 8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen-obstructing. thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual. The wall. adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the. vessels. The RX situation is likely explained by the fact that the tumor plug causing. intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection. margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of. the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of. bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have. been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region. immediately next to one of the tumor-infiltrated large pulmonary vessels."

The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. vhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and. 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #3 performed by. ADDENDUM # 4: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

Tumor characteristics: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. Location: Left lower lobe. Focality: Unifocal. Size: 2.0 x 1.8 cm, as measured grossly. Grade: Well differentiated. Lymphovascular space invasion: Not identified. Visceral pleura involvement: Present. Margin status: Bronchial margin: Negative, at least 1 cm (see third specimen). Stapled margin: Negative, 0.7 cm (also see third specimen). Pleural margin: Negative (confirmed by CK7 immunostain). Lymph node status: Negative for metastatic malignancy (0/6--includes four nodes from level IX excision and two nodes from the lobectomy completion). Lymph nodes, level IX, regional excision: See above. Lung, left lower lobe, completion lobectomy: Negative for residual malignancy. Bronchial margin is negative for malignancy. Additional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic malignancy (0/2). Other: Specimen integrity: Intact for pathologic assessment. Treatment effect: Not identified. Staging: pT1, NO. COMMENTS: The patient has history of renal cell carcinoma. Some of the areas of carcinoma have clear cell features while others demonstrate chromophillc features. Therefore, immunohistochemical stains are performed to more conclusively exclude the unlikely possibility of a renal carcinoma metastasis. Likewise,. further assessment of the visceral pleura is performed. The results are as follows (controls stain appropriately): Block A2. CK7: Strongly positive. p63: Negative in tumor. CD10: Negative in tumor. Block A3: CD10: Negative in tumor.

COMMENT: Within the submitted tissue, there is a 3.9 cm, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which in part is of clear-cell. type. Based on the solitary nature of the neoplasm, we favor it being a primary lung tumor, however,. immunohistochemical stains are being performed to rule out the possibility of metastatic disease. In total, seven lymph. nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma, six of these being from the hilus and one being a tracheal-bronchial lymph. node. Since we are unsure what level the tracheal-bronchial lymph comes from, the pathologic stage is T2, N1, MX. Results of immunohistochemical stains will be reported in a separate addendum.

The larger node is bisected. and the specimens are entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled. AS-2. RY: 1 - Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node. G. Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement. labelled ""left lung"" is an intact lung with two lobes. weighing 442 grams. There is a suture line present at the. amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary. artery and main left pulmonary vein. The pleural surface of the. lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are. evident. Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are. present adjacent to the bronchial stump. There is a mass that is. palpable in the interlobar fissure. This appears to be below the. surface of the lung. Sections are placed through the mass and this. reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main. bronchus. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 X 5 X 4 cm. It. arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that. grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor. There does appear. to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor. adjacent the bronchus. Portions of the t. ormal lung are. submitted for procurement per request of. Further. sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to. the pleural surface of the lower lobe. This pleural mass as central. necrosis and measures maximally 3 X 2 X 1.5 cm. It has the same. fleshy tan-white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules. It. is. crepitant gray-tan tissue without focal nodularity. Sections after. fixation. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 -. pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4-7 - dominant tumor. mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11. random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13-14 -. bronchial lymph nodes. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left. lung have a similar histologic appearance. Both are. moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells. exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. It is not clear from. the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an. intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor. Results of. the. evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : Two lesions are present. The larger lesion. measures 6 X 5 X 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 X 2 X 1.5 cm. (pT2). Margins of resection: Bronchial and vascular margins of resection. are free of tumor. Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. Direct extension of tumor: Absent. Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative. Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative. Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain. metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6) . All mediastinal lymph nodes are. negative (pN1) . Distant metastasis (pM) : Cannot be assessed (pMX). DIAGNOSIS. A. Lymph node, R4, resection: Negative for malignancy. B. Lymph node, L4, resection: Negative for malignancy. C. Lymph node, level 10, resection: Negative for malignancy. D. Lymph node, level 5, resection: Negative for malignancy. E. Lymph node, subcarinal, resection: Negative for malignancy. F.

There are other regions in the right upper lobe with interstitial. density. suggesting. scarring. There is a posterior pleural based density as seen on image #25. There may be a nodular density. in the right upper lobe on image #30 versus scarring measuring 7 mm. There is a very small nodular density lateral. portion. right. upper lobe on image #33. There is no evidence of pleural fluid. There are degenerative changes in the. spine. There is vascular calcification. There are a few nodes in the mediastinum. There is a pretracheal node. measuring 1.8 X 0.8 cm. There are a few smaller nodes at the AP window. Evaluation of the hila is somewhat limited. without contrast. There is váscular calcification including coronary involvement. Adrenal glands appear mildly. thickened without definite mass. IMPRESSION: 1. There is a noncalcified mass density of concern for a neoplasm in the left lower lobe posteriorly. 2. There are bilateral apical opacities right greater than left which may be due to scarring. In light of asymmetry a. superimposed mass cannot be excluded. PET scan may be helpful to evaluate the various abnormalities. The lungs. appear hyperexpanded and there are regions of peribronchial thickening and interstitial density which are consistent."

This result was reviewed and interpreted by. The following polymorphism was detected: 2361g>A. Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any. sequence changes that could result in amino acid changes. However, one or more polymorphic sequence changes were discovered in the EGFR gene. These. polymorphisms are interpreted as non-pathogenic because they do not lead to amino acid changes. These polymorphisms are not expected to have any. clinical significance. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene, a negative result. does. preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors. KRAS Mutation Analysis. KRAS Mutation: NOT DETECTED. Based on sequence analysis, no mutations were detected in K-Ras exon 1 (codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (codon 61). This result was reviewed and interpreted by. FISH, ALK, 2p23. FISH, ALK, 2P23: SEE BELOW. Specimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue. Clinical Indication: FISH study for oncology. Method FISH. Total Cells : 100. Images Captured : 2. INTERPRETATION : FISH RESULT NEGATIVE FOR REARRANGEMENT OF ALK GENE, SUGGESTIVE OF GAIN OF ALK REGION. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using break-apart probes specific for ALK gene (2p23; Abbott Molecular), did not exhibit a break-apart. pattern. Thus, this result is not indicative of a translocation involving the ALK gene. As an incidental finding, additional 1-6 copies of the ALK region were observed in 79% of cells. This suggests gain of the ALK region. The clinical. significance of this incidental finding is unknown. A small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated by other methods may be missed by this study. This. does not rule out a malignancy or other genetic changes. This result should be considered in combination with other clinical and/or laboratory. data. The cutoff values for ALK rearrangement are 12% for paraffin-embedded specimens, 3% for bone marrow, 5% for peripheral blood. Please expect. the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report. This test was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. Laboratory results reviewed and Clinical Interpretation provided by. Mutational analysis of the EGFR and KRAS genes and ALK locus rearrangement by FISH were performed to survey the most common tumor-associated. genetic changes that have been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic consequences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR. kinase. domain mutations are found in 10-15% of lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those occurring in younger patients without a smoking history,. and. identify tumors that may have significant clinical response to EGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors. Secondary somatic mutations in EGFR, particularly. T790M in exon 20, may accompany acquired resistance to these inhibitors. KRAS point mutations occur in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinomas and are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations are. associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-EGFR-directed immunotherapy. ALK locus rearrangement resulting in the EML4-ALK gene fusion is present in 3-5% of NSCLC, is most commonly seen in adenocarcinomas from. younger patients, and produces overexpression of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Patients who harbor ALK rearrangement do not benefit from EGFR tyrosine. kinase inhibitors and are recommended to be directed to trials of ALK-targeted agents. The. exons. tested. cumulatively comprise greater than 95% of the known activating mutations in the selected genes; rare mutations occurring at other sites. or in other genes that may influence outcome cannot be excluded. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tissue sections isolated from the submitted block. PCR-based DNA sequencing. was. used to assess for mutations in exon 1 (including codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (including codon 61) of KRAS and exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. (TK) domain. The sensitivity for mutation detection for these assays is approximately 10% mutant allele in the background of normal allele in the. microdissected area. The KRAS and EGFR test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. Capistrano. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. The FISH test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. It. has. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The specimen is received in multiple parts with the first. received fresh. This consists of a wedge of lung which measures. approximately 3 cm in maximum dimension. Basal margins are. present. The specimen is sectioned to show a 6 cm calcified. yellow-white nodule. The specimen is submitted totally after. decalcification. The specimen received as level 2, is received in formalin and is. designated specimen ""B"". This consists of a single piece of. gray-black tissue measuring 3 mm in greatest dimension, totally. submitted. The specimen received as left upper lobe is designated specimen. ""C"", and is received fresh. This consists of a lobe of lung which. weighs 138 gm and measures 14 x 9 x 4.5 cm. The surface shows. marked puckering of the pleura and this area is inked prior to. sectioning. The bronchial margins are removed for frozen. section. Sectioning the lung shows a firm lobulated gray-white. tumor which is subpleural in location, although grossly does not. appear to extend through the pleura. The tumor measures 4.1 x. 2.3 x 3 cm. It is located beneath the pleura and approximately 1. cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung parenchyma is. not involved by tumor, it is pink and soft. Sectioning the. peribronchial tissue shows a large lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in. greatest dimension. This is inked with blue dye and sectioned. into three parts. A possible additional node is identified. It. is placed in cassette 7. Sections have been submitted as. follows ""C1"", bronchial resection margin; ""C2-5"", tumor with. pleural margin inked; ""C6"", random sections and ""C7"", bronchial. node. The specimen received as ""level 6 lymph node"" is designated. specimen ""D"", and this consists of two lymph nodes with the. larger one measuring 2 cm in maximum dimension. This is bisected. and placed in cassette 1. The other node measures 1 cm in. greatest dimension, and this is bisected and placed in cassette. 2. An additional 4 mm node is added in cassette ""D1"".

TCGA-78-7167.a164a9ae-8f90-4deb-83ce-8f111897e5d6,1,"HISTORY. Pneumonectomy. Left pneumonectomy. Left lung cancer. Left lower lobe crossing fissure into lingula. MACROSCOPIC. Four specimens received. The specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and comprises a left lung, 240 X 170 x 40 mm in the fresh state. A. 30 mm length of bronchus protrudes from the hilum. There is an area of induration and puckering on. the lateral aspect of the pleura of the lower lobe. There is also an area of induration and puckering in. the interlobar fissure. A further area of induration is present posterolaterally on the upper lobe. A. number of emphysematous bullae are present at the apex and in the anterior margin of the upper lobe. Serial parallel slicing through the lung parenchyma reveals a tumour mass approximately 65 mm in. greatest diameter abutting the pleura of the lateral aspect of the lower lobe. This tumour has a fleshy,. grey, somewhat mucoid, cut surface. Posteriorly it merges with adjacent lung parenchyma and its full. extent is difficult to appreciate macroscopically. At its upper aspect, in the region of previously noted. puckering in the interlobar fissure, tumour appears to cross into the upper lobe. There is extensive. greyish-white consolidation extending from this point anteriorly into the lingula. It is unclear whether. this represents tumour or infective consolidation. Beneath the area of puckering noted on the postero-. lateral aspect of the upper lobe, there is a separate area of parenchymal consolidation and possible. fibrosis. The remainder of the upper lobe parenchyma appears emphysematous. In the lower segments. of the lower lobe there is no evidence of emphysema and there is very little anthracosis. However, on. the medial aspect, towards the diaphragmatic surface of the lung, there is an area of plaque-like pleural. thickening approximately 10 mm in diameter and 2-3 mm in depth. [1A, bronchial resection margin. and peribronchial lymph nodes; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1E, tumour and overlying lateral. pleura; 1F, tumour within interlobar fissure; 1G, lingular consolidation; 1H, subpleural consolidation. and fibrosis in posterolateral aspect of upper lobe; 1I, representative upper lobe parenchyma; 1J,. plaque like nleural Lesion from medial aspect of lower lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""aortopulmonary window"" and consists of three irregular reddish-brown. pieces of fatty tissue which measure in aggregate 10 X 10 X 2 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""inferior pulmonary ligament"" and consists of an ovoid-shaped piece of. greyish-black tissue, 12 X 7 X 5 mm, which has a smooth outer surface and is covered in a small. amount of fat. [Bisected and BIT, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""lymph node"" and consists of two irregular nodular pieces of tissue which. have a slate-grey appearance. The larger piece measures 18 X 5 x 4 mm and the smaller piece measures. 15x4x2 mm [Each portion of tissue is BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show that the majority of the tumour comprises well-differentiated papillary. adenocarcinoma. Focally there is stromal invasion by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a. more usual acinar architecture, Tumour abuts but does not invade the lateral pleura. However, at its. superior aspect it does cross the interlobar fissure into the upper lobe (1F), and there is extensive. contiguous infiltration of the lingula (1G). The abnormal area in the posterolateral aspect of the upper. lobe (1H) is an entirely separate deposit of histologically identical papillary adenocarcinoma with. adjacent fibroelastotic scarring and emphysema. This presumably represents a metastasis, although a. synchronous primary tumour cannot be excluded. Definite vascular or lymphatic invasion is not. identified in any of the sections, and none of the peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic. adenocarcinoma. The plaque-like pleural lesion on the medial aspect of the lower lobe appears to. represent artefactual diathermy injury. 2-4: Sections of each of the separately submitted lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic. adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Left pneumonectomy: Papillary adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe, 65 mm in diameter, crossing interlobar fissure into left. upper lobe. Separate focus of adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe.

EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of. s and up to 40% in the. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small. cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor calls in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using. standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the. KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then. forward and reverse sequencing was performed using the. on. AB/3130. ). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations with Mutation Surveyor V3.07.

Two peribronchial lymph nodes were identified within specimen #4,. the left lower lobe lobeetemy. One of the twe bronchial mph nodes. demonstrates a small focus of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this is. staged as a pN1. The level 10 lymph nodes left lung, level 7 lymph nodes left lung,. and level 5 lymph nodes left lung were all received fragmented and. therefore an accurate node count cannot be performed. An elastic stain was performed which demonstrates the adenocarcinoma. to extend up to but not into or through the visceral pleura (with. appropriate positive control).

TCGA-55-5899.8fcdc599-a63e-4774-a58d-8b1b19d13980,0,"FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: Adenocarcinoma - see comment. COMMENTS: Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting. primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete. glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent. nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small. cell carcinoma, grade Il neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical. carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm. stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as for TTF-1. The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight. keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of. adenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for. synaptophysin. It is felt in that this is an example of. non-neuroendocrine carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) that shows. positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not. result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of. EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to. help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be. significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are. mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show. that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in. adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to. TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the. ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation. analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene. rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on. paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic. tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are. available on request as a panel or as individual assays. This case has been reviewed by. who agree with the diagnosis. FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Bronchus,right, washing: Negative for malignant cells. Respiratory epithelial cells, squamous cells and macrophages. are present. COMMENTS: CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a. with a right upper lobe. lung mass. CODES: 88112. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.

TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pNO pM1 (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.2 M8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantly. tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate. immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a. (hematogenous) metastasis that - despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cell. morphology in places - is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous. remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral. bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick-walled. pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial. occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the. observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the. pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space. Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci). CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. (in the smaller focus more than in. the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant. protein B. This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the. view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus. seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor."

COMMENT: In Part 2, special stain for elastin shows that the neoplasm extends into but not through the visceral pleura. A. microscopic focus of neoplastic cells is present within the arterial wall at the vascular margin of resection. This. neoplastic focus is seen on the frozen section and not on permanent section. Deeper levels of this margin. are. non-. contributory. The frozen section slide was reviewed and our diagnosis regarding this margin remains unchanged. Given. the positive vascular margin, the tumor clusters in part 7( nodule on aortic arch) likely represents contiguos spread rather. than a true etastsis. Hence, this lesion is best classifies as Pt4 N2 Mx. In Part 7, cytokeratin stain confirms the presence of neoplastic cells of epithelial origin within the vessel wall. has been. ordered to confirm the epithelial origin of the neoplastic cells.

Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobectomy which measures. 140 X 120 x 50 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the. apical segment, predominantly on the posteromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 X 65. X 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pleural surface at the apex. The. pleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there. is a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous-. like architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut. the pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. There is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The. tumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a collapsed. appearance. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B-F, tumour; 1G, adjacent uninvolved lung. parenchyma; 1H, hilar lymph nodes]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of four irregular greyish-black pieces of. tissue which measure in aggregate 30 x 20 X 10 mm. [BIT, 2A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a prominent. bronchioloalveolar component with a marked papillary pattern. The cells are tall and columnar with. variable cytoplasm ranging from non-mucinous to clear to mucinous. The lesion is subpleural but. definite pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic. permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial. resection margin. Tumour appears to be present at a diathermied margin, possibly related to pleura in. block 1F. It is difficult to know whether this represents a true margin. No lymph node metastases are. present.

NOTE: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. BACKGROUND: EGFR mutations are present in about 10-15% of non-Asian and up to 40% of the Asian patients with non-small-cell lung. cancer (NSCLC) (1,2). They are more frequent in non-smokers, females, and in tumors with adenocarcinoma. histology. Activating EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions, exon 21 point mutations (L858R, L861Q), and exon 18 G719A/C/S. point mutation are associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (gefitinib,. erlotinib) (2-4). Advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations show response rates of more than. 70%,. with. progression-free survival up to 14 month (2,3). However, EGFR mutations in exon 20 (insertions and T790M point. mutation) are associated with acquired resistance to TKIs (4). KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are found in. approximately 30% and 2% of lung adenocarcinomas respectively. The most common mutation types are KRAS codon. 12/13 and BRAF V600E. Patients with these mutations tend to be resistant to erlotinib and gefitlnib (2,5,6). However,. not all tumors reveal such a correlation and, therefore, the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in. conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target or more than 300 cells for FNA specimen were. accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the. detection of. mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene and exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. Then,. forward. and. reverse sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130. The sequencing electropherograms were. analyzed for the presence of mutations. The method sensitivity is approximately 20% of mutant alleles in a background of. normal. DNA. For. detection of BRAF mutation, real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601 sequences. Post-PCR. melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by. sequencing of the PCR. product on ABI3130. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA. nesuits. ALK translocation is detected as follows: ALK negative: 0-15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Normal cells without the ALK translocation show green and orange signals in juxtaposition. ALK positive: Greater than 15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Cells with the ALK translocation show one of the following patterns: One pair of signals (green and orange) fused or in juxtaposition. and one green and one orange signal separated; Only split O & G (single o and single G in the same nucleus); Only single O;. Fusion + single O. c-MET amplification is detected as follows: RP11-163C9,. c-MET FISH positive: Gene Amplification: Ratio gene/chromosome more than two. c-MET FISH negative: Ratio gene/chromosome less than two. FGFR1(Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1) is a protein coding gene whose largest transcript features 18 exons, measures 5.6. kb and is located on chromosome 8p11.2.The FGFR1 probe mix consists of a green 154kb probe telomeric to the FGFR1 gene. spanning the LETM2-202 gene and D8S135 marker. The red probe is 52kb centromeric to the FGFR1 gene spanning a. 108kb. region including the D8S389 marker. FGFR1 FISH positive: Gene Amplification: Ratio gene/chromosome more than two. FGFR1 FISH negative: Ratio gene/chromosome less than two."

COMMENTS: Three copies of ALK were observed in 32.0% of cells. This. gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals represents an. aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK. region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs,. although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung. carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2011;6:21-27). ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4) [38/50]. This Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test (. is FDA. approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the. ALK gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer. (NSCLC) tissue specimens. Addendum #4 performed by.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 2C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. vhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addenaum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Elastic. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1B appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of smoking. (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian population, common in. non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually. exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Addendum. PROBE Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probe. TM. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.07 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 30% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 60 cells were. analyzed in the targeted region. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Summary Statement. The right lower lobe superior segment demonstrates a 2.5 cm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. associated with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. All sampled lymph nodes are benign. Surgical resection. margins are free of tumor. The pathologic stage is T2N0Mx. The right middle lobe demonstrates a 0.6 cm typical carcinoid. Numerous carcinold tumorlets and diffuse. neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia are seen throughout the right upper, right lower and right middle lobes. PART 1: LYMPH NODE, SUBCARINAL, BIOPSY -.

COMMENT: This case in addition to invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrates typical carcinoid in the right. middle lobe associated with numerous carcinoid tumorlets and diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. A primary lung. origin of carcinoid is confirmed by positive TTF-1 and synaptophysin immunostalning. CDX2 and calcitonin are negative. Surgical resection margin of the right middle lobe demonstrates scattered small microscopic foci of neuroendocrine. cells. However, based on the gross description it seems that margin is negative for tumor and these neuroendocrine. cells may represent another focus of tumoriet.

The specimen as received on reconstruction is 15.6 x. 9.6 x 5.9 cm and has as the margin of resection the stapled. bifurcation of the tertiary bronchi, as well as several additional. vascular and parenchymal staple lines. Adjacent to the bronchus is a. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm lobulated fleshy gray-black nodule. The pleura is. slightly wrinkled gray-tan to pink. On the upper anterolateral. aspect at a point approximately 4.0 cm from the upper portion of the. specimen there is an area of indurated umbilication over an area of. 6.5 cm extending onto the lateral aspect. The anterior extending. to. the lateral aspect of this indurated pleura is overlaid by gray-tan. fibrinous material.

TCGA-05-4396.96f3b48a-c5c4-40c3-a3d1-64477499c6e6,3,"Main diagnosis/diagnoses: Very extensive, pneumonia-like, imposing bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with a. predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, as well as slight mucin. formation and formation of numerous, in parts very small foci within the parenchyma and. minimal pleural invasion and lymphogenous metastatic spread. Comment/supplementary remark: By definition, the foci of mixed adenocarcinoma detected not only in the immediate. environment of the tumor, but in some cases only at microscopic level, are to be classified. satellite nodes in the lipsilateral lobe, which - bearing in mind the location of the lymph node. micrometastases (samples 5.), 7.) and very probably also 1.)), as well as the absence of tumor. in the resection margins of the bronchus and the vessels - gives a tumor classification of pT4. pN1 R0. But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar. differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even favored. that this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The. stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of. the resected right lower lobe.

An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12S (c.34G>A) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION. Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #2 performed by."

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. EGFR MUTATION ANALYSIS. Patient ID #: Date Collected: Date Received: Client Lab ID #: Treating Physician: Hospital ID #: Client Specimen ID: Body Site: Left. lung. Specimen(s) Received: Paraffin embedded tissue. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however, 18-20% of patient with non-small-cell. lung cancer and without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; based on the. current literature, the vast majority of mutations are expected to occur in. these exons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations. present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa). Similar data have. been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva). A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A was identified. This. polymorphism is not likely to have clinical significance. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical. significance and utility of this test in other tumor types is unknown. METHOD LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant rumor is selected or. analysis, DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified and amplified by. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using. capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative. results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic. heterogeneity of the tissue sample. END OF REPORT."

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in six parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a. wedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a. staple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length. There is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in. length. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area. measuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the. staple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is. inked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon. parenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for. frozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a. single lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is. grey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, right middle lobe: wedge resection (FS). - Invasive adenocarcinoma. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

Control values. 2p23(ALK) 100 0 <15.0. A total of 100 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the. Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23. When a rearrangement involving ALK is. present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion. signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this. specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored. This result is within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 59.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time. ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4)[59/100].

An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled ""Lung Bx, frozen section' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent. [Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and. peribronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection. margin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid. area of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying. pleura, 2I; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (?.

[Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12. mm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, 5A.]. MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen.

EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the L858R mutation in Exon 21. INTERPRETATION: The L858R mutation is reported to correlate with. responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. L858R corresponds to 2573T>G. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>1 A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown.

Part one is received fresh, labeled 'wedge superior segment right. lower lobe, stitch at nodule, freeze nodule, at 09:28'. It consists. of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The. staple line measures 11 cm which is shaved and the parenchyma around. is inked blue. The pleura are gray pink glistening and reveal a pre. cut which is marked with a stitch. The precut area of the pleura is. puckered and reveals a gray white ground glass nodule, measuring 0.8. x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line margin. The remainder of. the parenchyma is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No other nodule is. grossly identified. A frozen section is performed on the nodule. marked with a stitch and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative sections are submitted. 2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right middle lobe'. It. consists of right middle lobe of the lung, measuring 16 x 9.5 x 3.2. cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.8 cm and the vascular margin. measures 1 cm at the hilum. The pleura is gray pink glistening and. moderately mottled with fine black streaks. Also noted a precut and. puckered area on the pleura. Beneath the puckered area there is a. gray white subpleural firm nodule measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm,. located 1 cm from the staple line margin and 2 cm from the hilar. stricture. Cut surface of the nodule is gray tan and reveals some. necrotic area. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink red blotchy. and emphysematous. Multiple anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from. 0.3 cm up to 0.6 cm in largest dimension are identified from the. hilar area. 80% of the nodule and representative section of the. specimen are submitted. 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'. It consists of five anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to. 0.8 cm. Entire lymph node is submitted in one cassette. 4.

Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change."

Date Complete: Results-Comments. At the request of Dr. a representative portion of this case was. sent to Molecular Pathology for KRAS mutation analysis. This addendum is. created to report those findings. Cerner accession number: Body site: Left lung, left upper lobe. Specimen type: Paraffin embedded tissue. Surgical Pathology Block number: No KRAS mutations were detected (Wild Type KRAS) at codon 12 of the. KRAS gene in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be. analyzed. INTERPRETATION: No KRAS mutations were identified at codon 12 of the KRAS gene. in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be analyzed. METHODIASSAY LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist before. processing. DNA is isolated and the exon 2 of the KRAS gene is amplified by PCR. PCR products are subjected to Shifted Termination Assay (STA-TrimGen) technology. to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13. STA products are analyzed by capillary. gel electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. This assay is validated for the. detection of mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. Mutations in other. codons of KRAS are not evaluated. False positive or negative results may occur. for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue. sample analyzed. Mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be. detected. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other. laboratory information findings for the most accurate interpretation."

No carcinoma identified. PAS 4,6 SPC-A. Comments. This is staged as a pT1b lesion based on the size of 2.4 cm in. greatest diameter. The final stage should be performed in. conjunction with the clinical information. Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated large cell. carcinoma. A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed. including CK5/6, p63, TTF1 and CK7 (with appropriate positive and. negative controls). The neoplastic cells are positive for TTF1 and. CK7. The neoplastic cells are negative for CK5/6 and p63. The. overall histologic appearance in conjunction with the. immunohistochemical stains is consistent with a poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma. In addition, some dense eosinophilic. collagenous scar tissue is present suggesting this may have. represented a so-called scar carcinoma. The carcinoma extends up to. but not into the visceral pleura, being separated from the pleural. margin by less than 1 mm. Clinical correlation and follow up is. recommended.

Located approximately 2 cm. from the staple line is a 1.0 x 0.8 cm area of pleural puckering. Beneath the pleura is an ill-circumscribed mass. measuring approximately 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The periphery of the mass is firm and gray, and the center is. cavitated. No additional masses are identified throughout the remaining parenchyma. Intraoperative touch. preparations are prepared. A small portion of the mass, as well as normal lung, is obtained for the. Three sections of the mass with overlying pleura (inked black) are submitted in A1-A3. INTRAOPERATIVE TOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: Non-small cell carcinoma. B. Received fresh is a 106 gram, 17 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm lobe of lung. The pleura exhibits minimal to moderate. anthracotic stippling Towards the center of the resection is a 10 x 5.5 cm defect in the pleura, representing the. prior wedge resection. The edges of the pleural defect are 1.5 cm or greater from the staple line. Sections of the. lung reveal a spongy tan-red parenchyma with no additional masses. Near the bronchial margin (which is 2.5 cm. or greater from the stapie line) are several small anthracotic fymph nodes. The bronchial margin is submitted for. frozen section in B1. representative sections of lung parenchyma in B2 and B3, and lymph nodes in B4.

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR targeted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21. mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population, common in. and. associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and. their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy. number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,. time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY STATEMENT.

Comment/supplementary remark: According to the conventional histology, the findings are consistent with a peripheral mixed. bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma (C 34.1, M 8255/3), the TNM classification of which on. the basis of these samples is pT2 pNO pMX L1 V1 RX, corresponding to stage IB. (Immunohistological analysis as to the tumor's point origin will follow.) The tumor shows. foci of infiltration in the visceral pleura and extends to the basal resection margin, which. gives rise to RX classification from the patho-anatomical viewpoint. The immune profile (positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, negative for cytokeratin 20 and. CDX-2) confirms the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor."

Four specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which. measures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour. measuring 70 X 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but. definite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and. intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour. involvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. The visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are. identified grossly.

There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the. tumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural. infiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small. silicotic nodules but definite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is. present within intraparenchymal lymph nodes from the left lower lobe (1J). A single fragment sampled. as a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (1D). Lung. parenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal. anthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. 2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma. SUMMARY. Left pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling: Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter.

This section has been reviewed and approved by the. nn. Staging. Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it. is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the. cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps. the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis (chance. of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancers. There is no standard system for staging thymoma; however, the most commonly used system is called. the Masaoka system. This system was developed in. and it classifies thymoma into the following. stages: Stage I: The cancer is limited to the thymus and the capsule that surrounds it. Stage II: The cancer has spread into fat surrounding the thymus or into the lining of the lung next to. the tumor, called the mediastinal pleura. Stage III: The cancer has spread to other organs that are near the thymus, such as the lung, blood. vessels, and the sac around the heart, called the pericardium. Stage IVA: The cancer has spread more extensively into the lining of the lung or the sac around the. heart. Stage IVB: The cancer has spread to organs further away from the thymus, or has spread through the. vessels carrying blood or lymph. Classification. In addition to its stage, thymoma can be classified into different categories, developed by the. ), based on what the tumor cells look like under a microscope: Type A thymoma. This is also called spindle cell thymoma or medullary thymoma. The chance of. recovery for people with type A thymoma is good, with a. survival rate (percentage of. people who survive at least. after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) near. TypeAB thymoma. Also called mixed thymoma, type AB thymoma is similar to type A thymoma;. however, type AB thymoma has lymphocytes in the tumor. The chance of recovery for people with. type AB thymoma is also good, with a. survival rate of approximately. %. Type B1 thymoma. This is also known as lymphocyte-rich thymoma, lymphocytic thymoma,. predominantly cortical thymoma, and organoid thymoma. This type of thymoma has very many. lymphocytes in the tumor, but the cells of the thymus appear normal. The chance of recovery for. people with type B1 thymoma is also good, with a 20-year relative survival rate (percentage of people. who survive at least. years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) of approximately. Type B2 thymoma. Type B2 thymoma also has many lymphocytes, like type B1 thymoma; however,. the thymus cells do not appear normal. Type B2 thymoma is also known as cortical thymoma and. polygonal cell thymoma. The. Fyear relative survival rate for people with type B2 thymoma is. approximately. Type B3 thymoma. Type B3 thymoma is also known as epithelial thymoma, atypical thymoma,. squamoid thymoma, and well-differentiated thymic carcinoma. This type of thymoma has few. lymphocytes, and the thymus cells look abnormal. The. survival rate is approximately. Thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma, previously called type C thymoma, is very rare and more. aggressive. Thymic carcinoma cells do not look like normal thymus cells, but like cancers in other. organs of the body. This type of tumor is often advanced when diagnosed. It is classified into two. categories: low grade, which has a better chance of recovery, and high grade, which is more likely to. grow and spread quickly. Low-grade thymic carcinoma includes basaloid, mucoepidermoid, and well-. differentiated squamous cell types. High-grade thymic carcinoma includes anaplastic/undifferentiated. clear cell, poorly differentiated squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and small cell/neuroendocrine types. The. five-year relative survival rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. %. Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from. thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States, but the actual risk for a particular. individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a person how long he or she will live with thymoma. < Previous. Next >."

Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Lymph node #7. HISTORY. Lung cancer. GROSS. A. Specimen received in fresh for frozen section labeled as ""right. upper lobe-check bronchial margin"" consists of lobe of the lung. weighing 270 grams and measuring 18 x 8 x 5 cm. Bronchial margin is. processed for frozen section. After initial fixation the specimen is re-examined. The maximal. diameter of the tumor is 7.7 cm and is immediately beneath a. puckered but. apparently intact overlying pleural surface that is opposite this. side of the bronchial resection margin. The distance from the. bronchial resection margin to the nearest portion of the tumor is. about 1 cm. On cut surface, the tumor is mostly pale white, flecked. with gray and black with some mucoid material and foci of necrosis. Multiple staple lines are present pulling together portions of the. pleura along the resection margin of the hilum and adjacent tissues. On further inspection, some of the tumor appears to come very close. to the stapled margins in the area of the hilar portion and such. areas are marked with blue dye to aid in identification in sections. I do not see tumor actually reaching the surface, but it may be very. near. All staple lines are trimmed and the closest soft tissue. margin, which is very near the bronchial resection margin is sampled. as two pieces in block A2 which represent also tumor that is closest. to the bronchial resection margin. Possible bronchial lymph nodes. are taken in block A3. Additional major bronchi and blood vessels. near the margin are taken in block A4. Neoplasm nearest the. bronchial end is taken as blocks A5 and A6. The neoplasm just. beneath the puckered area of the pleura is taken in blocks A7 and. A8. Additional neoplasm is taken in blocks A8 and A9, including. areas of overlying pleura. Uninvolved portions of the lung appear. emphysematous are taken in blocks All and A12. In summary, this is a large neoplasm in the long occupying a large. portion of tissue removed with tumor growing just beneath or perhaps. into the pleura, but not apparently going through it. At the hilar. aspect tumor comes very close to some of the soft tissue margins,. but we know the bronchial resection margin is negative. Also,. available peribronchial lymph nodes are small, but dark and are not. grossly involved. B. ""Lymph node #10. "" Multiple pieces of pale tan to off-white and. focally red-brown tissues range from 4-10 mm across. C. ""Lymph node #7. Multiple pieces of brown-black lymph node. tissue range from 6-12 mm across.

SPC-A. Comments. The histologic sections of the neoplasm demonstrate a poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma composed of large. pleomorphic cells with large nuclei demonstrating irregular nuclear. contours. In areas, the cells demonstrate smooth chromatin; in other. areas, the nuclei appear more vesicular. The cells are arranged in. groups and clusters including large sheet-like growth patterns. Rare. pseudoglandular-like structures are noted. Occasional cells appear. vacuolated. To better characterize this neoplasm, a limited panel of. immunohistochemical stains is performed (with working controls). The. cells are strongly positive for CK5/6 and positive for CK7. The. majority of the nuclei are positive for p63 (greater than 75%). Occasional nuclei (approximately 10%) appear positive for TTF1. The histologic and immunohistochemical features of this neoplasm. have overlap between both adenocarcinoma as well as squamous cell. carcinoma. In areas, features histologically compatible with. squamous cell carcinoma are seen. In other areas, however, features. of adenocarcinoma are present. Clinical correlation is recommended.

TCGA-50-5931.396c0f5f-1b86-4aa9-88ef-ca9220f4ccf3,1,"Addendum. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization studies have been performed on the adenocarcinoma. The ratio of Her2/Neu gene to the. centromere of chromosome 17 is 2.19, indicating amplification. The ratio of cyclin D1 gene to the centromere of. chromosome 11 is 2.10, also indicating amplification in the targeted region. The ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 is 1.03, indicating a lack of amplification in this area. Her2/neu and Cyclin D1 amplification may help in identifying those patients likely to experience shorter survival when. considered together with other major risk factors. Addendum. Special stains were ordered for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and mucin to further characterize the tumor and to rule out. the possibility of a neuroendocrine origin for the tumor. Chromogranin and synaptophysin stains were negative, consistent with the previous diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma. Although the tumor shows clear evidence of gland formation, the mucin stain was negative, which is occasionally seen in. more poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. These results do NOT change the previously rendered diagnosis of a moderately to poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY STATEMENT. This lobectomy specimen from ""left upper lobe of lung"" demonstrates a moderate to poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma (3.3 cm.). The tumor has neuroendocrine features.

The specimen consists of the left lower lobe, measuring 17 X 13 X 9 cm and. weighing 285 grams. The pleural surface is smooth and congested. The medial. aspect reveals a portion of adherent pulmonary tissue (possibly from the left. upper lobe), measuring 4.0 X 2.5 X 1.7 cm. The adherent tissue has a staple. line, measuring 4 cm in length. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal. a well-circumscribed tan-white mass, measuring 6.5 X 6.0 X 6.0 cm. The mass. is composed of tan-white firm tissue with focal necrosis. The mass is 1 cm. from the bronchial margin. The remaining specimen shows tan-pink spongy. pulmonary parenchyma with focal congestion. No sac-like lesion is. identified. The bronchial and vascular margins are unremarkable. Three hilar. lymph nodes, ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, are. identified. Sections show moderate anthracosis. Representative sections are. submitted in nine cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - bronchus at the frozen. section piece; cassette 2 - vascular margin; cassette 3 - three hilar lymph. nodes; cassette 4 - adherent portion with staple line; cassettes 5 through 7. mass: cassettes 8 and 9 - lung parenchyma away from the mass.

Not for Permanent Storage in Medical Records / Not Valid for Signing. MICROSCOPIO DESCRIPTION: Nine slides are examined. The bronchial margin appears on cassette 1 and. does not show any evidence of involvement by tumor. Portions of vascular. margin appear on cassette 2 without evidence of tumor involvement. Three. hilar lymph nodes are present on slide 3. All of them show extensive. replacement by non-oat cell carcinoma. Portions of lung mass are seen on. slides 4 through 7. The tumor demonstrates extensive necrosis on slide 4, and. the remaining pattern is that of a moderately to poorly differentiated. carcinoma with numerous areas showing clear cells along with typical malignant. glands. There is extensive intrapulmonary lymphatic and vascular invasion. Pleural lymphatics on slide 4 are filled with plugs of tumor and both veins. and lymphatics of the interlobular septum show tumor involvement on the same. slide. Extensive involvement of the visceral pleura is also noted on slide. 5. On slide 6, there is a foca area showing dyskeratotic cells consistent. with squamous differentiation. Focal areas of bronchioalveolar. differentiation are noted on slide 6. On slide 7, small areas of vascular. involvement are present with plugs of tumor present in endothelial lined. spaces. On slide 8, which is said to represent lung tissue taken away from. the tumor there appears to be a minute independent focus of poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma. One slide is examined. A portion of bronchial wall with cartilage is. present. No tumor is seen. This supports the frozen section diagnosis. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A. 1.

Resident Pathologist: FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS --. FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE: STAPLED MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. The specimen is received fresh labeled. ind. designated right upper lobe. It consists of a grossly recognizable. lobe of lung that weighs 250 gms, and measures 20 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm. The. staple parenchymal margin measures 17 cm in length. The entire. parenchymal margin will be sampled for histology. One particular area. of concern raised by the surgeon was frozen with frozen section. diagnosis as above. There is in fact some firmness felt underneath the. parenchymal margin. Upon serially sectioning through the lung, this. area of firmness appears to be secondary to bronchopneumonia. A tumor. mass is identified which measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. This. white tan tumor mass approaches the parenchymal margin no closer than. 4.2 cm. Between this nodule and the overlying stapled parenchymal. margin is the area of firmness consistent with bronchopneumonia. There is however one additional smaller nodule that is white tan in. color measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. This other nodule is. separate from the main tumor nodule. This nodule is surrounded by the. firm gray tan tissue reminescent of pneumonia. This second nodule. approaches the stapled parenchymal margin, no closer than 2.2 cm. The. bronchial and vascular margins grossly appears well away from the. tumor and approach no closer that 4.0 cm from the main tumor mass,. and 6.2 cm from the other suspicious smaller nodule. In the area of. the lung adjacent to the tumor in the area away from the pneumonia. the lung appears focally cystic. The remainder of the lung specimen. is congested. No other lesions are identified. Black and white and. color photographs of the specimen are taken. In one region the tumor. appears grossly to approach the overlying pleural surface with some of. focal hardening and puckering of the surface. Representative sections. are submitted.

Received fresh for. intraoperative consultation is a 162 g lower lobe of. lung measuring 14.5 X. 11.5 X 3.5 cm. The pleural surface is tan to gray-. brown and lightly. wrinkled with 3 subpleural nodular structures ranging. from 0.4 to 0.6 cm. along the base. Along the posterolateral aspect near. the base is a 2.7 X. 1.0 cm firm tan subpleural mass that comes to. within approximately 5 cm of. the bronchial margin, which is shaved and submitted. for frozen section. The. overlying pleura is puckering and is focally inked. blue. Sectioning through. the separate subpleural nodules reveals glistening. gray-tan cut surfaces. The background lung is tan to red and spongy white. to white-tan hilar lymph. node measuring 0.5 and 0.6 cm. Microscopic Description. The bronchial margin is negative for carcinoma. In the section from the. bronchial margin, a small lymph node is identified which is negative for. metastatic carcinoma. Also, there are two additional hilar lymph nodes. which are both negative for metastatic carcinoma. The lung mass is an. invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma merging with a peripheral. bronchioloalveolar type pattern. The invasive carcinoma focally involves. the visceral pleura surface. In this area, free floating tumor cells are. seen in blood clot external to the visceral pleura surface. The vascular. margins are negative for neoplasm. No angiolymphatic space involvement by. tumor is seen. The separate subpleural nodules are consistent with small. foci of metaplastic epithelial proliferations (honeycombing). These nodules. are composed of epithelial cells that have a mucinous as well as. nonmucinous appearance and many demonstrate cilia. There is a focus of. squamous metaplasia associated with one of these areas. There is no nuclear. atypia. Nonneoplastic lung shows emphysematous features. Immunohistochemical stains are performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX 2 and. Napsin A. Control material for each individual stain demonstrates. appropriate staining. The malignant cells are positive for Napsin A, CK7. and TTF-1. There is focal positivity for CK20. The malignant cells are. negative for CDX 2. These findings support the interpretation of a primary. lung adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis Details. Comments. LUNG CARCINOMA CHECKLIST. 1. Tumor Type: Adenocarcinoma. 2.

Four specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe"" and consists of a left lower lobe which measures. approximately 120 X 130 x 100 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation of the lower zone of the. lobe there is a firm to hard mass which has caused some puckering of the pleural surface of the base of. the lobe. The pleural surface surrounding the rest of this firm to hard area has a pale brown, slightly. nodular, appearance compared to the normal appearing pleura. On sectioning there is a well-defined. greyish-brown solid mass which has a mucoid cut surface. It measures 75 x 60 mm in maximum. dimension. The tumour appears well clear of the bronchial resection margin by at least 40 mm. Distant lung parenchyma has a collapsed mottled pinkish-grey appearance. [1A, bronchial resection. margin; 1B, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-F, tumour with nearest pleural surface; 1G-H, tumour with pleural. puckering 11, distant uninvolved lung parenchyma]. 2: The specimen is labelled with patient's details only and consists of an irregular portion of lung, 33 x. 25 x 22 mm, bearing a stapled margin, 30 mm in length. The remainder of the specimen is largely. covered by pleura, but on the opposite side to the stapled margin, there is a ""bare area"" approximately. 30 X 15 mm. The stapled resection margin has been removed and the bare areas inked. Serial parallel. slicing reveals lung parenchyma in which there is evidence of emphysema but no mass lesions are. identified and there is no definite evidence of fibrosis. [3 representative TS, 2A-B]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""lingular node"" and consists of three fragments of firm cream and grey. tissue ranging from 4-11 mm in greatest diameter. [Wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""No. 11 lymph node"" and consists of three portions of firm grey and cream. tissue ranging from 2 mm in diameter to 15 x 10 x 5 mm.

On sectioning, the cut surface is gray-black and friable. The. specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. E/EPC. The specimen is received in formalir and consists of a single lobe of. lung, weighing 212 grams and measuring 15 X 14 x 14 cm in overall dimensions. The hilar region consists of two portions of bronchus, measuring 1.5 cm in. length X 1.0 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in length X 1.0 cm in diameter. There. is also a 0.5 cm portion of vessel (the hilum). The structures are surrounded. by six gray-black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest. dimension. There are also two stapled resection margins at the hilum,. measuring 7.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in length. The stapled margins are. trimmed and inked green. The hilar region is inked black. The pleural. surface is purple-black with moderate anthracotic pigmentation. The surface. is smooth with the exception of the 0.5 cm area of puckering on the lateral. aspect. The pleural surface in this area is inked black. On sectioning,. there is a well-circumscribed mass adjacent to the puckered area which. measures 5 X 5 X 4.5 cm. The cut surface of the mass is yellow-tan soft and. gritty. with anthracotic pigmentation. The borders of the mass are rounded. serpiginous. The mass involves 40% of the cut surface and comes to within 1.0. cm of the vascular resection margin, 1.5 cm from the stapled resection margin,. and 1.8 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The mass surrounds vascular. and bronchial structures. On sectioning through the bronchus, the vessels are. yellow-tan and smooth. There is no obvious involvement of the bronchial and. vascular structures by the aforementioned mass. The mass abuts the inked. pleural surface. The remainder of the specimen consists of mildly crepitant. pink-red parenchyma. There is minimal anthracotic pigmentation. On. sectioning, scattered gray-black intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. (cassette 8). No additional masses or lesions are identified. Representative. sections are submitted in ten cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - bronchial. and vascular margins; cassette 2 - mass and portion of bronchus; cassette 3 -. mass with vessel; cassette 4 - mass with inked pleural surface; cassette 5 -. mass with surrounding uninvolved parenchyma; cassettes 6 through 8 -. uninvolved parenchyma with the stapled resection margin in cassette 6;. cassette 9 one lymph node, bisected; cassette 10 five lymph nodes.

Comments. Histologic sections demonstrate a well to moderately differentiated. adenocarcinoma that in areas demonstrates features of. bronchoalveolar carcinoma. However, evidence of desmoplastic. fibrosis and invasion of this stroma suggests this is better. classified as an adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified. The lesion. extends close to, and in many areas abuts, the elastic layer of the. visceral pleura; however, definitive extension into this elastic. layer is not identified on H and E stained slides.

Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""right lower lobectomy"" and consists of a right lower lobectomy. specimen which measures 70 X 80 X 60 mm. Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly. in the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 75 X 60 X 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan. colour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the. pleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen. to erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the. bronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection. margin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but. tumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the. inferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between 5 to 12 mm in. diameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within. the region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the. superior aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the. inferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable.

Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. measuring 200 X 80 X 20 mm in the fresh state. Overlying the apex and the lateral. aspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour. mass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnormality apart from. extensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected flush with the. hilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic. nodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. Sectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined. maximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20. mm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior. lesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. In some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung. parenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified. on serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1A,. bronchial resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1D longitudinal. sections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; 1E, sections of. inferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""left hilar lymph node' and consists of three. fragments of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT, 2A.]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small. amount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Extensive blood vessel invasion is noted and. there is possible lymphatic permeation. The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions. are separated by approximately 5 mm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a. bronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section of lung. This measures 5 mm in. diameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. Special stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the. bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence. of emphysema. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. 1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5. mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation. present. C: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. D: No lymph node metastases. E: T1NO (awaiting pleural stains). F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysema. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. 1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour with the acinar architecture. It is not. definitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. Both tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative. This indicates both lesions are. pulmonary in origin but considering their different architecture as they appear to represent synchronous. tumours.

There is, however, no material identified in our files for review and comparison. Accordingly,. a limited series of immunohistochemical stains is performed on a representative block of a malignancy. Sections are examined along with appropriately. staining positive and negative controls, with the following results: CK7- Positive. CK20 Negative. TTF1- Positive. RCC- Negative. Histologically, the malignancy does not resemble a typical renal cell carcinoma, and the staining pattern above essentially excludes the possibility of a. metastasis from the kidney, and is typical of a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The malignancy grossly approaches the stapled parenchymal surgical margin to within less than 0.1 cm. Following removal of the staple line, the inked. margin in this site is involved by malignancy. It is noted, however, that the nature of the stapling procedure itself precludes sampling of the true. surgical margin. Clinical correlation is suggested.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE (Frozen Section). - Invasive adenocarcinoma. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION. No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right lower lobe of Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750del5 mutation in Exon 19. INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the. LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell. lung carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for. this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 50% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. E746_A750del5 corresponds to 2235 2249del15. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,. this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a. mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown.

Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to help select patients for. Tyrosine-Kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase). gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Lung. Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on. or patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 4E appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or approved by the. US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such. clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for. clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or. for research. The laboratory is regulated under the Clinical. Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as qualified to. perform high complexity clinical testing. This particular test is. not considered a stand alone test and should be only used in the. context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work-up related to. treatment decisions.

Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown.

G) SOURCE: Left upper lobe bronchial margin for frozen section. Received fresh from the OR labeled ""left upper lobe bronchial margin for. frozen section and consists of a 3 g lung lobe (19 X 12 X 4 cm). The. bronchial resection margin is received stapled. The staple line is removed. and the subjacent tissue is taken en face for frozen section diagnosis. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSUL TATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Benign. bronchial margin"" is rendered by. The vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes are taken. The pleural surface. is tan-red to red-purple, smooth and glistening. There is a 9 cm staple. line grossly corresponding to the earlier wedge resection. The staple line. is removed and the subjacent tissue is inked blue. The staple line lies 4.5. cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung lobe is sectioned. revealing pink-tan to red-purple spongy tissue. No discrete masses or. lesions are identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in nine cassettes as. follows: 1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin. 2. Hilar lymph nodes. 3. Vascular resection margins, en face. 4. Staple line nearest bronchial margin. 5. Additional inked staple line. 6-9. Grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma. This case is accessioned in. MICROSCOPIC. A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm. the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly. composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant. eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of. tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests. with minimal acinar formation, although occasional foci of both. intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but. does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral. pleura. Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous. changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical. evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows: TTF-1: Positive. Napsin A: Negative. Negative. P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen. The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by. this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small. cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. Addendum. Sections of the Part 2 ""portion of fifth rib"" show normal bone and bone marrow with trilineage representation and maturation.

SPECIMEN/BLOCK NUMBER. aderocarciroma, NOS 814013. EGFR Mutation: NOT DETECTED. Results reviewed by. The following polymorphism was detected: 2361g>A. Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any. sequence changes that could result in amino acid changes. However, one or more polymorphic sequence changes were discovered in the EGFR gene. These polymorphisms are interpreted as non-pathogenic because they do not lead to amino acid changes. These polymorphisms are not expected to. have. any. clinical significance. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene, a negative result. does not preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors. KRAS Mutation Analysis. KRAS Mutation: DETECTED. (Abnormal) Results reviewed by. Based on sequence analysis, K-Ras codon 12 GGT>GAT (G12D) mutant was detected. Lung Ca (NSCLC),ALK,FISH: SEE BELOW. Specimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue. Clinical Indication: FISH study for oncology. Method FISH. Total Cells 50. images Captured : 2. RESULT: NEGATIVE FOR ALK REARRANGEMENT [SEE COMMENT BELOW). INTERPRETATION: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis did not reveal a rearrangement of the ALK gene. However, 1-3 additional copies of the ALK region. were. observed in 80% of cells. The significance of additional copies of the ALK region is not clear. In non-small cell lung carcinoma, overexpression of the ALK kinase is seen most commonly through an inversion producing ELM4-ALK fusion protein. A. small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated by other methods may be missed by this study. This test is. indicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom crizotinib (i.e. XALKORI) treatment is being considered. Correlation with clinical findings and. other laboratory studies is indicated. Please expect the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report. FISH test was performed using a break-apart probe specific for the ALK gene. According to the manufacturer's directional. insert, the cutoff value for ALK rearrangement is 15% of interphase cells in paraffin-embedded specimens.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Decalcification, AFB, GMS, Chromogranin, TTF1. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Genzyme Specimen #. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable. mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine. kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of. mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical. sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib. Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)). This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis.

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, tumor microdissection was. performed. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA. was amplified with primers flanking exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and reverse sequencing. was. performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on AB/3130 (Applied Biosystems). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations. with Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). Addendum. TM. PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Right Lower Lobe. PROCEDURE: Lobectomy. TUMOR SIZE: Maximum dimension: 6.0 cm.

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Lung cancer. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe lung and is received without fixative. It consists of a. lobectomy of lung weighing 163 grams. The lobe measures 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Just superior to the hilum. of this lobectomy specimen, there is a wedge resection of additional lung suggestive of apical portion of. right lower lobe. This adherent wedge resection measures 8 X 2.5 X 2 cm. The pleural surface of the. upper lobe varies from tan to violet and appears smooth with very little anthracotic stippling. Where the. lung wedge is adherent to the mid portion of the upper lobe, there is palpable firmness and slight. retraction of the pulmonary parenchyma. The wedge resection is similarly adherent to the pleural surface. of the lower portion of the upper lobe. A metallic staple line runs from the hilum of the lung along the. inferior edge of the upper lobe and is 11 cm in length. The pleural surface overlying the adherent lung. wedge and in the vicinity of the palpable firmness is inked blue. The staple line along the lung wedge is. dissected free and the resection edge is inked green. On sectioning of this area of palpable firmness,. there is a relatively well-circumscribed tan to pale yellow neoplasm which overall measures 3.5 x 3.5 X. 2.9 cm. This neoplasm abuts the pleural surface of the upper lobe and passes across the interlobar fissure. between the upper lobe and the apical portion of the lower lobe, to involve the adherent wedge resection. This neoplasm is 0.5 cm from the closest bronchial margin, abuts the pleural surface in several areas, and. is 0.4 cm from the stapled resection margin of the apical portion of the lower lobe. Sections of the. remaining lung reveal pale red pulmonary parenchyma which appears relatively well-aerated. At the. hilum of the lung, there are two 0.5-0.7 cm peribronchial dull red nodes. Dissection of the major bronchi. reveal no intrabronchial tumor. The neoplasm is 6 cm or greater from the inferior staple line. Representative neoplasm is obtained in its fresh state for research purposes. Following fixation,. representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial resection margins, A2) vascular. margins, A3) peribronchial nodes, A4-A5) tumor and pleural surface of upper lobe, A6) additional section. of tumor and upper lobe, A7-A8) full longitudinal cross-section extending from upper lobe into adherent. lower lobe wedge, including wedge resection margin, A9) tumor adjacent to upper lobe segmental. bronchus, A10) sections of upper lobe parenchyma away from tumor, A11) sections of wedge of lower. lobe away from tumor, A12) sections of inferior upper lobe along staple line.

COMMENTS: Histologic sections from the right middle lobe wedge show a hamartoma, as seen in the frozen section slide. However, in addition to this finding, there are. microscopic foci in sections not examined at the time of frozen section. These foci measure up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension individually. In addition,. this section in slide A4 also shows multiple microscopic foci of tumor within subpleural lymphatic spaces. The main tumor in the right upper lobe is that of an adenocarcinoma which is moderately to poorly differentiated. Two foci of bronchioloalveolar. carcinoma. are also present in the shaved parenchymal margin. Multiple positive nodes are present. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to help select patients for. Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKls and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Lung Cancer Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

Macroscopy: Specimen consists of a left lower lobectomy which measures 130 X 65 X 90 mm. The pleura overlying. the anterior basal segment is puckered and shows a small amount of adherent pale tissue. On. sectioning the lung in this area, there is diffuse infiltration by pale and tan tumour which has a rubbery. cut surface. The tumour appears to abut the lateral and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces. The lesion. measures approximately 50. X 60 X 45 mm. The tumour also involves the posterior lateral basal and. anterior basal segments. Tumour appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close. to the bronchial resection margin. The tumour does not appear to involve the medial margin. [Tumour and diaphragmatic pleura, A; tumour and medial pleural surface, B; tumour and lateral. pleural surface, C-D; bronchial resection margin, E; tumour and bronchus immediately adjacent to. bronchial resection margin, F; hilar nodes, G; non-neoplastic lung, H.]. Microscopy: Sections show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar. carcinoma component. Focally the tumour appears to be invasive. It closely abuts the pleural surface. Overlying this there is a thick organising fibrinous pleurisy. Although definite invasion of the pleura is. not seen, there are suspicious features and special stains will be performed. No vascular or perineural. invasion is seen. Small satellite deposits of tumour are scattered throughout the adjacent parenchyma. These are also identified in the parenchyma of the section taken of the bronchus immediately adjacent. to the bronchial resection margin (Block F). Both the bronchial resection margin and the bronchus. within the immediately adjacent section show no evidence of malignancy. No metastases to hilar. lymph nodes are seen. The lung tissue away from the mass in block H shows no specific abnormality. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: Specimen consists of a single piece of grey firm tissue which measures 12 X 5 X 5 mm. Microscopy: Sections of the lymph node show carbon deposition and sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of. metastatic malignancy. Summary: Left lower lobe and hilar lymph node: 1. Invasive well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a predominant bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. (mucinous type) pattern. 2. Pleura probably not involved by carcinoma but confirmatory stains are being performed. 3. No vascular or perineural invasion or lymph node metastases are seen. 4.

The case report, slides, and blocks for. the cited accession number were retrieved from archives. The. pathologist whose signature appears below reviewed the original. pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block. 4M appropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular. analysis. 1 H&E and 9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded. to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13. of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Testing performed at. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION:"

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR targeted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21. mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population, common in. and. associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and. their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy. number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,. time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Summary Statement. The right upper lobectomy and superior segmentectomy of the right lower lobe reveals a 2.4 cm poorly differentiated. mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe, 2.4 cm in diameter, associated with angiolymphatic and. visceral pleural invasion with involvement of the right paratracheal lymph nodes, with all margins free.

FOUR (4) FRAGMENTS OF LYMPH NODE WITH REACTIVE CHANGE. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY. COMMENT: The adenocarcinoma is an interesting one having both moderate and poorly differentiated areas, with the former. characterized by cells with abundant vacuolated foamy, light eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounding pools of mucin. In. some areas, psammoma bodies are identified, and in still other areas zones of solid growth are prominent. In several. areas, focal squamous differentiation is seen, however, this comprises only a small percentage of the overall tumor. (<10%) and therefore, we have chosen not to classify this as an adenosquamous carcinoma. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA: - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Right Upper Lobe.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection: - Adenocarcinoma. ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on. 1. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis. and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may. occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic. heterogeneity of the tissue sample. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under the. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS. Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #3 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. INTERPRETATION: Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene. Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %. Control values. 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0. A total of 100 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections. using dual color break-apart probe. to the ALK. gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement. involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two. probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In. this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei. scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are. within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (. ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4) [42/100]. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or."

Received fresh in a single container labelled. nd designated ""left lower lobe. completion"" and consists of a single lobe of lung weighing 256gm. The pleural surface ranges. from tan red to black red and is rough with adhesions. The bronchial margin is removed and. submitted en face in a single block labelled FSA1 for frozen section diagnosis. A large mass is. palpable within the lung tissue and the pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The specimen. is serially sectioned and an irregularly shaped tan yellow soft to focally firm tumor measuring. 6.0x3.4x2.5cm. is identified. This tumor abuts the pleura focally in several places but does not. appear to grossly invade through the pleura. One of the places where it is closes to the pleura is. directly adjacent to the bronchial margin. The bulk of the tumor is 0.7cm. away from the nearest. portion of the bronchial margin. Another smaller similar appearing tumor measuring 1.4cm. in. diameter is noted approximately 0.5cm. away from the larger tumor. One anthracotic level 11 and. one anthracotic level 12 peribronchial lymph node are identified. The bronchi are opened distally. from the bronchial margin and the bronchial mucosa is uniformly tan without masses or lesions. The tumors do not grossly appear to arise from any major bronchus. The remainder of the cut. surfaces are composed of tan red poorly aerated lung tissue. Representative portions of both. normal appearing lung tissue and tumor are submitted to tissue procurement.

Areas of subpleural fibrosis associated with carcinoma (see. comment). Stage: pT2a NO SPC-A. CPT: 88309, 88304 x 4, 88342 x 5,. Comments. Sections of the tumor show a well differentiated mucinous. adenocarcinoma. Focally, in one residual bronchus, an area of in. situ adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition, some subpleural. fibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma. as opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of. immunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2,. and TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The. neoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic. cells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The. neoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. In addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive. staining cell for CDX2. This demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung. neoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and. therefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully. excluded on histologic grounds alone. Clinical correlation and. follow up is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have. been additionally reviewed by. tho concurs with the. diagnosis. This test has been finalized at the. This test was devolaned and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been. cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. F/S LEFT UPPER LOBE NODULE: (Frozen Section). - Predominantly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma with focus of invasion. (acinar pattern). Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. ADDENDUM # 2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS and EGFR were sent on. or patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Genzyme Specimen #: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable. mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine. kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of. mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical. sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)). Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)). Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A. was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical. significance. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis.

Resident Pathologist: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name. and designated as left upper lobe. It consists of a grossly. identifiable lobectomy specimen, measuring 18.0 X 8.2 x 3.3 cm and. weighing in aggregate 163 gm. In the epical half, on the lateral. aspect of the lobe, is a tumor mass, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest. dimension. The mass has an irregular infiltrating border and involves. the pleural surface, such that the pleura is puckered in the area. overlying the tumor. This area of puckering measures 2.5 cm in. greatest dimension. The tumor is approximately 0.5 cm from the hilar. bronchial margin and appears grossly to involve large branches of the. right upper lobe bronchus and blood vessels. On cut section, the. tumor is tan-white and gray, marbleized in appearance. There are two. staple lines on the specimen. The epical staple line measures 4.5 cm. in length and the more inferior staple line measures 6.0 cm in length. The tumor approaches to within 0.5 cm of the epical staple line. The. staple lines are removed and the lung parenchyma adjacent is inked. blue. The pleural surface overlying the tumor has been inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing no other lesions. Representative sections are submitted. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS. - A- M (VASCULAR MARGIN). 1. - B- 2 (BRONCHIAL MARGIN). 1. - C-.
