ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2.

Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analvsis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation.

ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above. reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen. and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

The breast measures 23 cm from medial to lateral, 21 cm from superior. to inferior, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. On the anterior surface is. 20 X 8.5 cm ellipse of skin with a 4.2 X 4.0 cm areola and a 1.3 X 1.3 X 0.5 cm. nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or. retraction.

The mass is 1.6 cm. from the anterior-inferior margin and abuts the posterior margin. Surrounding. the mass is a 10x7x4 cm ill-defined, pink area composing of dilated ducts. and fibrotic tissue in slices 4-9 and the most prominent in slice 7-8. The. ill-defined area (lesion #2) extends towards anterior aspect and is 0.6 cm from. the closest anterior margin and 2.0 cm from the closest posterior margin. The. remainder of the specimen consists of approximately 10% dense gray-white fibrous. breast parenchyma and 90% lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses. or nodules are grossly identified. Within the axillary tail are identified. several lymph node candidates measuring from 0.3-2.5 cm in greatest dimension.

The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. ISHDIG. detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals (SISH). and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells.

Regional lymph nodes: pN1c. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Stage: IIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Indeterminate. Margin status: Negative. COMMENT: The three foci of invasive carcinoma have similar histologic features,. although the tumor grade is somewhat variable in the largest tumor nodule, where. there is a variable rate of mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism ranging from. intermediate to high-grade.

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. CLINICAL HISTORY: year-old white female with breast cancer. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION. A. Received fresh labeled ""left axillary sentinel nodes"". are two slightly rubbery tan-white-pink tissues in keeping. with lymph nodes measuring 0. and 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension.

'left breast mass"" is a 7.3 cm. (medial to lateral) x 6.5. cm. (superior to inferior) x 3.7 cm. (anterior to posterior), soft,. lobulated tan gold-white portion of fibroadipose tissue with two. sutures as stated previously. The margins are inked as follows: Anterior - blue, posterior - black, superior - green, and inferior. orange. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral. There is. a central, moderately well-circumscribed, 3.2 cm. (medial to. lateral) x 2.5 cm. (superior to inferior) x 2.4 cm. (anterior to. posterior), firm tan white tumor mass with several central. associated cylindrical tan white structures in keeping with cyte of. prior needle core biopsy. A portion of tumor and a portion of. normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The tumor appears to focally extend to within 0.3 cm. of both the. anterior and posterior inked margins. The cut surfaces throughout. the remainder of the specimen consist predominantly of glistening. lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a minimal amount of. interspersed dense tan-white fibrous tissue. No additional. abnormality is noted. Representative sections are submitted in. a. sequential manner from medial to lateral in 10 blocks as labeled. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative perpendicular sections medial. margin cap; 2-9 sequential sections; 10 - representative. perpendicular sections lateral margin cap. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. A. Microscopic examination involved the evaluation of the. four H&E stained sections of each of the tissue blocks. Also pan cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunohistochemical stains were. evaluated of each tissue block and no metastatic tumor was. identified in any of the examined sections (0/2) (snpNO). B.
