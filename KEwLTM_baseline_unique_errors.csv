LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY received fresh labeled with the patient's name. and designated ""LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY"" is a piece of fatty tissue, 8. 0 x. 5.0 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm, impaled with a needle localization wire. The specimen. is oriented with sutures (short=superior, long=lateral) and is inked as. follows: Red=medial and lateral, blue=superior, green=inferior,. yellow=anterior, black=posterior. The needle localization wire enters the. specimen at the lateral margin. The tip of the wire is embedded in the mid. portion of the specimen. The accompanying specimen radiograph is reviewed. and shows numerous calcifications in the area of the wire localization. The specimen is serially sectioned, medial to lateral, revealing a poorly. differentiated mass, 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, corresponding to the. area of radiographic abnormality. The mass is firm and nodular, and. contains at least two vell-circumscribed masses with a tan, gritty cut. surface. The largest of these well-circumscribed - masses measures 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension. The 3.0 cm mass abuts the superior and inferior. margins. The remaining tissue is variably fatty and fibrous; the fibrous. tissue is firm and nodular in some areas. Sections of tumor and grossly. normal fibrous tissue are harvested for the. rotocol.

Now, let's look at the T stage categories.""T1"": The tumor size is 5 cm or less;""T2"": The tumor size is more than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm;""T3"": The tumor size is more than 10 cm or the tumor has grown into the chest wall;""T4"": The tumor has grown into the skin (including ulceration and satellite nodules) or the chest wall, including the ribs, or the tumor is inflammatory. Based on the given information, the tumor size is 5.8 cm, which falls under the T2 category.

The report mentions that the tumor is invasive mammary carcinoma and forms multiple masses, with the largest one measuring 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. This indicates that the tumor is greater than 1 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size. \\n2. The report also mentions that the tumor closely approaches the original inferior margin (0.1 cm). However, this does not change the T stage as per the AJCC guidelines. \\n3. The report also mentions that there is no angiolymphatic invasion identified. \\nBased on the above information, the patient's breast cancer falls under T2 category, which is defined as a tumor that is greater than 1 cm in size but not greater than 5 cm in size.

This is because the invasive tumor measures approximately 2.0 cm in largest dimension, which falls within the T2 category (2.0-5.0 cm). The location of the tumor does not affect the T stage, so the final decision regarding the T stage is T2.","From. To. P.8/33. RIGHT AXILLA, SENTINEL #1, SENTINEL NODG BIOPSY -. AVILLARY LYMPH NODE.

The T stage is based on the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded the surrounding tissue. Here's how we interpret the report: \n1. From the macroscopic description, we know that there are two tumors with sizes 1.8 cm and 1.2 cm. We take the larger size for T staging, so T = 1.8 cm. \n2. The report mentions that 'margins of resection are free of infiltrating tumor', but 'ductal carcinoma in situ extends to involve inked anterior margin and infiltrating tumor extends to within 0.3 cm of the anterior margin'. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not considered in T staging, so we focus on the infiltrating tumor. The tumor extends to within 0.3 cm of the anterior margin, but it doesn't invade the margin. \\n3. There's no mention of invasion into the skin (T4) or the chest wall (T3), or of inflammatory breast carcinoma (T4d). \\n4. Based on these findings, the patient's pathologic T stage is T2, as the largest tumor size is between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm (2.0 cm > 1.8 cm) and it hasn't invaded the skin or chest wall.","FATIENI MISTURT: DATE of LMP: DATE OF LAST DELIVERY: PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: LEFT BREAST CANCER.

Here's the step-by-step interpretation: \n1. Identify the tumor size from the report: The report mentions 'Tumor size: 2 x 0 x 2.2 cm.' This indicates that the largest diameter of the tumor is 2.2 cm. \\n2. Compare the tumor size with the AJCC's T stage criteria: \\n- T1: Tumor 2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension \\n- T2: Tumor more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension \\n- T3: Tumor more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension \\n- T4: Tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall and/or skin \\n3. Based on the information provided, the patient's tumor size is 2.2 cm, which falls under the T1 category. However, the AJCC does not use the other two dimensions (0 and 2 cm) for T staging, so we should ignore those. \\n4. Since the tumor size is 2.2 cm, it is larger than 2.0 cm, and thus does not qualify for T1a or T1b. \\n5. The report does not mention any direct extension to the chest wall or skin, so we can rule out T4. \\nTherefore, the final decision regarding the T stage is T2, which is not an option in the provided choices.

The report mentions three invasive lobular carcinoma masses with maximum dimensions of 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm. The largest mass measures 2.0 cm. Therefore, the patient's T stage is T2. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Identify the largest tumor size: The report states that there are three invasive lobular carcinoma masses with maximum dimensions of 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm. The largest mass is 2.0 cm. 2. Compare the tumor size with AJCC's TNM Staging System: According to the AJCC's TNM Staging System, T2 indicates a tumor size of 2.0-5.0 cm. Since the largest mass in this patient is 2.0 cm, the T stage is T2. The presence of perineural invasion, close margins, and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) do not affect the T stage. The T stage is based solely on the size of the largest tumor. Therefore, the patient's T stage is T2.  \\  }","DIAGNOSIS.

In the report, the size of the tumor is not explicitly stated. However, since the tumor is described as an 'infiltrative neoplastic lesion' and it is composed of cells that are 'almost 100% viable' without any areas of necrosis, it suggests that the tumor is relatively small and has not outgrown its blood supply. Therefore, we can infer that the tumor size is likely to be T1 or T2. \\nTo further classify the tumor size, we can refer to the AJCC's TNM Staging System for breast cancer, which defines T1 as a tumor that is 2 cm or less in size, and T2 as a tumor that is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size. \\nThe report mentions that the tumor is an 'infiltrating lobular carcinoma grade II,' which suggests that the tumor is moderately differentiated and may be slightly larger than a T1 tumor. However, without explicit information on the tumor size, it is difficult to determine the exact T stage. \\nTherefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is either T1 or T2.

Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present Both have positive axillary. lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region. of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left. side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is. associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is. difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast. carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors (. Left and. right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel . The carcinomas were. both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with. regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive. necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status. Às this case was received in the department such that. it. does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some. difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the. left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin. fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block C1 with 5 hours of. formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further. evaluated for HER2/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH.

TCGA-OL-A97C.1582865E-9294-4D78-8B16-92FB70381D15,2,unknown,"The report does not provide information about the size of the primary tumor, which is the key factor in determining the pathologic T stage in the AJCC's TNM Staging System for breast cancer. The report only mentions that the patient underwent a mastectomy for a malignant phyllodes tumor, but it does not provide information about the size of this tumor. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the T stage based on this report alone. However, I will provide an overview of how to interpret the report according to the AJCC guidelines for educational purposes. \\n\\nStep 1: Identify the primary tumor. In this report, the primary tumor is a malignant phyllodes tumor located in the left breast. \\n\\nStep 2: Determine the size of the primary tumor. The report does not provide information about the size of the primary tumor. \\n\\nStep 3: Identify any invasion of the tumor. The report does not provide information about any invasion of the tumor. \\n\\nStep 4: Determine the T stage based on the size and invasion of the tumor. The AJCC's TNM Staging System for breast cancer has the following T stages based on the size and invasion of the tumor: \\n\\n- T1: The tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the skin or the chest wall muscle. \\n- T2: The tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in size, or the tumor has invaded the skin or the chest wall muscle but not both. \\n- T3: The tumor is more than 5 cm in size or the tumor has invaded the skin and the chest wall muscle. \\n- T4: The tumor has invaded the chest wall and/or the skin beyond the areola, or the tumor has inflammatory carcinoma. \\n\\nSince the report does not provide information about the size and invasion of the primary tumor, it is not possible to determine the T stage based on this report alone.
