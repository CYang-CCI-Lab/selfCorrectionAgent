Core biopsy showed DCIS, here for wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None given. ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: D9. Interpretation: NEGATIVE. Intensity: 1+. % Tumor Staining: 8%. Fish Ordered: No. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

A suture tags the. axillary tail which measures 5 x 3 x 3 cm. The chest wall margin is fatty and. unremarkable. This margin is marked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned. The breast tissue is mostly fatty without focal suspicious lesions. A couple of large. fatty lymph nodes are found in the axillary tail with the largest one measuring 3 cm in. greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1. nipple. A2-5 -. representative breast tissue moving medial to lateral. A6 -. chest wall margin, inked. RUN DATE: RUN TIME: RUN USER: SPEC #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued). A7. axillary tail. A8. one fatty lymph node. A9-11-. largest fatty lymph node. Specimen B is received in the fresh state labeled ""right modified radical mastectomy"". This is a breast with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin ellipse. measures 20 x. 15 cm. The breast measures 20 x 15 x 4 cm. The axillary tail measures 8 x 8. x. 3. cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The chest all margin is fatty without focal. lesions. The chest wall margin is inked black. There is some palpable nodularity along. the medial most margin and this margin is inked blue, Serial sections through the breast. reveal mostly fatty tissue with irregular areas of white fibrosis. In the central breast. roughly 3 cm inferior to the nipple is an ill-defined, indurated area suspicious for tumor. and associated with fresh hemorrhage. This area spans approximately 1 cm by palpation and. a portion of this area is submitted for tumor banking, handed off to. There. appears. to. be. a. separate tumorous area in the lateral breast roughly 6 cm from the nipple. and spanning by palpation roughly 3 cm. Again, this area is visually ill-defined. There. may be yet a third .11-defined indurated area in the far lateral breast spanning. approximately 7 mm. Several fatty lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail. These. measure up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: B1,2 -. nodularity in the medial most breast. B3. nipple.

E-cadherin stain is performed on the left breast. tissue in an area showing features of lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular. hyperplasia. The E. Cadherin stain is negative confirming this diagnosis. In addition to. the histologic sections one of the lymph node from the right modified radical mastectomy is. examined with Pankeratin stain.
