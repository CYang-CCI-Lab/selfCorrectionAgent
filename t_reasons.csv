Although the term 'bifocal' suggests two separate tumors, the T stage is determined by the size of the largest tumor focus. In this case, the largest tumor size is less than or equal to 5.0 cm, but greater than 2.0 cm, which falls in the T2 category. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), vascular invasion, and the in situ lesion of the type cancerisatio lobulorum do not impact the T stage.

However, it does not provide information on the size of the tumor. The report does mention that the tumor is bifocal, but this term refers to the presence of two separate tumors in the same breast, not the size of the tumors. Therefore, we must rely on the information provided in the macroscopic description. The macroscopic description mentions 'carcinoma ductale bifocale' with a 'visual area diameter: 0,55 mm'. However, this measurement likely refers to the size of the biopsy, not the size of the tumor itself. Therefore, we cannot use this information to determine the T stage. However, the report also mentions 'carcinoma ductale in situ (DCIS) within the tumours (solid and cribrate type with high nuclear atypia, and point and comedo. necrosis, 10% of the tumour areas)'. The presence of DCIS does not impact the T stage. Based on the information provided, the tumor size cannot be accurately determined due to its diffuse nature. However, we can use the best estimate based on gross examination.
