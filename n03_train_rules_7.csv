Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality. 5. No carcinoma identified. Note: This is an unusual tumor. H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests. of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosis. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prior core. needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct. diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internal positive control present). CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background. SMM: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid cells in most areas. The above Immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER. expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell Immunophenotype. (positive p63) and the positive CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenoid cystic carcinoma. represents a dual population of basaloid and epithelial cells, it may be that this example is somewhat. rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also. explain the rather diffuse CD117 staining. The absence of a define myoepithelial layer by the SMM. further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression profile is also suggested. Drs. and. have reviewed selected stides form this case and. concur with the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous. population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were. performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary. follicies. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their Identity. as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity. as B cell follicies.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block A1. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Working Draft.

(0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of. cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate. intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100). provided by Dako (. following the manufacturer S instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistocnemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 6 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 3 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. D11. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.29. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1H (left segmental mastectomy @ 2:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, this specimen is. not amplified. Although amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene. and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The. average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26.
