This indicates that there are cancer cells present in the regional lymph nodes (N1, N2, or N3 stage) and the number of positive lymph nodes is 9 out of 12 examined. According to the rules provided, the N stage should be determined based on the pathological examination of regional lymph nodes, not on imaging studies or clinical assessments. The report mentions pathological examination of the lymph nodes, so we can use this information. The rule also states that substaging information, such as the number of positive lymph nodes or the ratio of metastatic deposits to the total number of examined lymph nodes, is not considered in determining the N stage for this specific case. Therefore, we can focus on the number of positive lymph nodes.

The exact number of positive lymph nodes is 1, as stated in the report (AJCC/UICC stage: pT2N1aMX).

The absence of cancer cells in regional lymph nodes corresponds to an N0 stage, while the presence of cancer cells in regional lymph nodes corresponds to an N1, N2, or N3 stage.

Based on the information given, we can conclude that the N stage is at least N1, but it is not possible to determine if it is N2 or N3.
