metastasis in any lymph nodes indicates N0 stage.\nThe number of positive lymph nodes is used to determine N stage in cases with metastasis in axillary lymph nodes\nThe presence of extranodal extension in a lymph node indicates a higher N stage\nAssessment of sentinel lymph nodes is necessary to determine N stage\nA high burden of metastasis in axillary lymph nodes suggests the presence of extranodal extension and indicates a higher N stage\nExtranodal extension in a lymph node indicates a higher N stage\nThe presence of metastasis in 5-9 axillary lymph nodes indicates N2a stage",
